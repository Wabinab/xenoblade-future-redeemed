<p>Matthew dragged backwards and stood up to face Alpha again. He was exhausted, but it's not the time to fall yet. He seemed invincible, releasing only more energy as time passed. He had difficulty even to get near him. Gradually, the power of Ouroboros he released, pressurized by the power of Alpha, pulled his soul out of his cask. The others had difficulty maintaining their own balance, what says helping him.</p>
<p>Shulk: "<strong>Careful!</strong>"</p>
<p>Rex: "<strong>Crap!</strong> Now he's trying to suck Matthew in too!"</p>
<p>A: "He's found it... The trace of turmoil, that's still within him..." The memories with Na'el, the last moments of Grandad, the wish to find back the people of the City, these memories flowed through him.</p>
<p>Alpha deluded, "Discard the past. Let it all go, Matthew." Despite efforts, his soul moved forward, one step by another, as the black hole overcame his will.</p>
<p>"I... I won't...!" Na'el was still unconscious, hung upon the air, 'waiting' for him.</p>
<p>"What harm did your kind do? You have done nothing wrong. You simply strode forth towards the future. But the olden humans... They did <strong>not</strong> find value in it. You must have realized? This is <strong>not</strong> where you belong."</p>
<p>"St... <strong>Stop</strong>..."</p>
<p>"Why make a martyr of yourself? Why be a stepping stone? For as long as the old is not excised, mankind, has no future!"</p>
<p>"<em>The old... you say?</em>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It's in your hands, Matthew!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"<em>Gotta be... kidding me... I'm... nowhere near done yet... I'm not dying with so much... left undone... I'm not... <strong>DONNNNNNEEEEEEEEEE!!!</strong></em>"</p>
<p>His shouts may had been heard. A purple beam stroke from above, broke the veil created by Alpha's energy, and sliced at Alpha. The Sword of the End pushed through and punctured his strength to none. His soul bumped back to his cask like an undeformed spring returning to its original state. Effete from fighting his will, he dropped to the ground. The hold on Na'el released, and she dropped to the ground, slammed under gravity's pull. Her shirt of Alpha disappeared.</p>
<p>Matthew immediately regained strength after a few moments of rest, dashed towards his sister.</p>
<p>Nikol shouted, "<strong>Matthew! Na'el!</strong>" And he followed behind. Matthew dropped to the ground and hugged her up, putting her between his hands. The rest of the group got near, shielded them as they reunited.</p>
<p>Glimmer's eyes wandered to the one whom sliced him down; he stood up, not looking at them. "<em>You again...!</em>"</p>
<p>Matthew: "N..."</p>
<p>"Don't- mistake- me. I am one who lives in the now. <strong>My blade knows no regrets.</strong>" Though his blade reverberated with the frequency of Nature.</p>
<p>"Huh... I thought you'd say that. And that's why..." He brushed his fingers through Na'el's forehead, despite her hair. "I can't afford to just take off."</p>
<p>"Mm Hmm..." She slowly opened her eyes, feeling the tickle.</p>
<p>"<em>Hey...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Matthew...</em>"</p>
<p>"Hey. You OK?"</p>
<p>"<em>Mm.</em>"</p>
<p>"Then... let's seize it together." With his help, she stood up, embraced. "Our true future."</p>
<p>"Hrrr... <em>I'm sorry...</em>"</p>
<p>"It's nothin'." Then called out, "N!" He's still looking away. "I've got a crapload of stuff I wanna say to you. But right this instant, I'm glad we're both fighting on the same side." He's not yet fallen, just temporarily stunned. "<strong>Am I right?</strong>" asked he to his team. No objections! "There you go. <strong>Mr. Alpha, sir. You wanna go so badly, then pick up and go! THIS WORLD - IT BELONGS TO US!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Regrettable, Matthew. I'd hoped that we could celebrate the day of departure together. But very well... It seems that I must forsake you.." His tone slowly changed from a soft one to more robotic and abominable. "The olden ones, olden life... Your olden notions!" Slowly by slowly, he retreated back into the void, merging with it.</p>
<p>The void gone and closed, darkness veiled the interior of Origin. The ground shook a few seconds later; he had not escaped. Slowly, they waited. Far away, rocks were sent along the boundary as light came to being -- the Big Bang. Wiping against all, the Aurora light formed their background against a non-starry sky. A ring with the void far in the distance, an eye peering at them. Alpha left an island floating amidst all, a space for them to stand. The asteroids reached the boundaries, forming a belt that rotated the battlefield. The void grew larger and splatted intense energy at the island. Sideways they stood, to cut through the waves. Into existence an elemental creature formed, with two arms and butterfly-like wings, veiled in light so bright there's no texture. It shook off the light to reveal its DNA-wings, its dark bony hands, the white-red body, a priest-like attire wore around its head, and the head like a factory-made robot's. It raised one of its hands, summoned the giant Monado, and brushed at the group's top.</p>
<hr />
<p>A hit one side; it aimed at her. Shulk attacked another side, got back on ground, exclaimed, "<strong>He's still standing...! After all this?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Cheers to old Klaus!</strong>" Rex ran towards it while it was focusing on Shulk. "<strong>His gifts just keep on giving!</strong>" All attacks never hurt its surface, even if it leaves smokes.</p>
<p>It raised the Monado, gathered energy, bashed at Rex, whom had no time to dodge, blocked it head to head. "<strong>Urrrrgghhh ARRRGGGHHH!!! DAMMIT!!! IF ONLY 'THOSE TWO' WERE HERE!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>N took the chance and slashed, but Alpha dodged it. He plucked the sword back into its scabbard, dropped beside "Matthew." What had he got to say? "Raise up your fists."</p>
<p>"What?" He looked at it. Only Ouroboros power in it, what?</p>
<p>"I will grant you the sword's power." Both his fist and the sword reverberates. "Transfer it to your... 'Fists of the End'."</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>A dropped down, noticed, "That light!"</p>
<p>Rex cannot understand, "No way..."</p>
<p>N shouted, pulling out his sword, "<strong>DRIVE IT IN!!! RELEASE THE POWER OF OUROBOROS!!!</strong>" He stuck it into the ground of Origin, releasing a huge amount of Ouroboros power despite being a Moebius himself. The energy acted as a catalyst for Matthew to activate more power.</p>
<p>"<strong>Shut the hell up already!</strong>" He jumped into the air, while still had time to complaint, "<strong>I ain't taking orders... from you!</strong>" His Fist of the End shattered into pieces, revealing a cross-like gem encased on the back of his fist. The power of Pneuma. "<strong>ARRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!</strong>" He punched it into the Sword of the End, hoping to pierce it deeper into the ground. Ouroboros power released in even more strength, brushed through his friends it.</p>
<p>Rings of energy slowly veiled everyone as the Ouroboros symbol glowed in everyone's eyes, the ring engulfed their body from toe to head, and they became the Ouroboros Core we saw on the main Xenoblade 3 story. All flew high up into the air, zoomed and swooshed and rotated, before forming into one. The precursor of Ouroboros in the future, with more than a single core -- each held a position of chest, both hands, both legs, and one on its lower abdomen -- on an illusory Dharma.</p>
<p>Alpha prepared a strike, it prepared a punch. The punch reached Alpha's face, the sword, despite longer, sliced above the shoulder of the Dharma, not breaking it, being illusory. A bright light engulfed, and in such space, Alpha, in his regular shirt, addressed,</p>
<p>"<em>Matthew... Your actions have made the future uncertain. Have you no regrets? Given a choice of this magnitude... Surely... there is doubt</em>." It's only him and Matthew; motes floating off him as he was about to die; he's losing his legs currently.</p>
<p>"Oh believe me, got 'em in spades." Alpha was surprised, and he can't understand. "That's why we move forward,... always ahead." The rest of the group joined him, watching behind.</p>
<p>He thought for a while, "Hmph..."</p>
<p>Matthew turned around, "See ya. Alpha." And walked away, while the light engulfed him and himself only, no more words to say. At the end of his life, he saw him joined with his group.</p>
<p>N was not in the group, as expected; stayed outside the blinding space. Matthew, back at the real space, looked at him; his sword tucked back into the scabbard, still reverberating, standing there speechless. The rest waited in silence, until a punch was heard. Looking around, it was as if Origin interior was to be destroyed.</p>
<p>A knew, her time had come. Bright light glowed on her surface, but not bright enough for Matthew to notice yet. Similarly for Rex, as motes also appeared. And equally, Shulk. But their smiles revealed they knew what would've happened.</p>
<p>Shulk: "Right we are. Just one last thing then." That attracted Matthew attention, whom saw him started walking forward, confused.</p>
<p>Rex: "Yeah. You got it."</p>
<p>"H-hey!" They had not told him this would've happened? Who said they had no more secrets to withhold? They were reaching for the bright blue light where Alpha had fallen.</p>
<p>Matthew was stunned when A stood beside him, explained, "Alpha was... And I am.. an avatar. The spirit of your world." While she walked slowly towards the beam, she continued, "Just like Alpha needed <strong>all</strong> of you, you and your world, you need me."</p>
<p>"<strong>An 'avatar', what?</strong>"</p>
<p>Their head not turning back, Rex spoke, "It's no more. So someone else has to pick up the slack. <em>The annihilation events, they'll keep happening whether you like it or not.</em>" He stopped for a while, looked back at him, "The world needs a bit of propping up."</p>
<p>Shulk stopped and turned his too, "Until the time comes, yes."</p>
<p>Glimmer felt nervous, dashed forward a few steps, "Hold up a minute, Who's 'someone'? And for how long?"</p>
<p>Rex bit his tongue and answered, "Hmph... Well... you work that part out."</p>
<p>"Urghhh..." Matthew and Nikol equally felt a bang in their stomach.</p>
<p>Nikol especially shook his head, don't want regrets, started dashing towards Shulk, stopped in front of him, "<strong>DON'T DO THIS!!! HURGGGHHH! YOU DON'T HAVE TO SACRIFICE YOURSELVES!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"It's not like that. We're helping."</p>
<p>Glimmer started to pick pace towards him too, "And that's different how exactly?"</p>
<p>"Fundamentally." Rex immediately shot back. She stopped and looked to her right, where Rex was walking towards her, "Glimmer. As long as you lot do your part to change this world, it'll all go back to normal."</p>
<p>"And if we don't manage, then what? My lifetime... it's barely a blip."</p>
<p>"<strong><em>If you don't, pass it on!</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Let someone else carry on your dream. That's how we've always rolled. Us lot."</p>
<p>Shulk: "It's not much, but we can offer you a gift." He looked at Rex, both agreed, "We can imbue you with our life, keep the wheels turning. That way, you'll be able to live out the rest of your lives. Enough time to do what you must." He put his hands on Nikol's shoulder.</p>
<p>"<strong>No, but-!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Oh, hey. Don't get us wrong now."</p>
<p>Glimmer looked aside and saw a big palm aiming for her head, "Urg,... urm..." closed her eyes, and felt the pat, but did not pull away. "We're just... taking a breather. It's all right. We'll meet again. Trust me."</p>
<p>"Uhm..." Nikol still felt not right. Can he really trust them?</p>
<p>Linka and Panacea did not joined in their family reunions, feeling sad, or in Linka's part, crying, at the back, looking.</p>
<p>"Teacher..."</p>
<p>"Boss..."</p>
<p>A crossed her arms, strictly speaking, destroying the sadness atmosphere, "This is against the rules. You know this."</p>
<p>Both turned around and joked, Rex: "Don't be a spoilsport now. If it was <em>'them'</em>... <em>I don't think they'd even bat an eyelid</em> at helping." His eyes turned to N's Sword.</p>
<p>"Hrmph... Admittedly..." A looked at N's sword and Matthew's fist. "Well, I suppose you have earned it. Very well then. I didn't see or hear anything."</p>
<p>Shulk, "Thanks a lot, 'Alvis'." The bright light from Shulk spread to Nikol, Rex to Glimmer. Both enchained the powers to remove their Term Symbol shackles.</p>
<p>"Then... It's all up to you now. With us taking the role of the avatar, Z may well seize upon it to gain power. What we did, and all that concerns Origin, will become but a dim memory... Nevertheless, our <strong>intentions</strong> will live on,... and one day, coalesce again. Be it tomorrow... or in a thousand years... Surely, the time will eventually come. I can see it, clear as day."</p>
<p>No more speaking. Three of them turned and went for their destined fate. The rest froze and watched, unable to change.</p>
<p>Rex: "Our future... is in your hands."</p>
<p>Shulk: "We'll be waiting, at the far edge of time."</p>
<p>Matthew took a step forward, but nodded in return, against his emotions. Peering over their shoulders{{footnote: not including A}}, they were glad he agreed. Even N watched their disappearance.</p>
<p>Inside the light pillar, now that others cannot hear them, Shulk asked, "You actually did see it coming, didn't you? All that's happened..."</p>
<p>Rex strongly believed: "Right? And all that will."</p>
<p>"The only thing I see is... what the flow encompasses... <em>But your hope lives on.</em> That much is certain."</p>
<p>Outside, Origin's rotating blades halt after their disappearance. Without such anti-gravity device working, it gets pulled down into the sea below, its trajectory aimed to destroy all lands below it. The City people had already been prepared, boarded their repaired Armories for an escape. As the flames burned on the heat shield of Origin, the crash sunk the ground, explosion ensued, and land became sea.</p>
<hr />
<p>Origin sank into the sea, bringing with it huge waves where it hits. Rocks, probably the tops of mountains, still visible as small rocks protruding out the surface of the waters. The impact so huge it carved a huge semicircle cliffs around where it was, and water falls from the remaining sea down to the bottom{{footnote: Though one don't know how it was recycled back to the top, given the amount of liquid falling down doesn't seem to one refillable by rain per se.}}.</p>
<p>Rain drops as the group was set to the top overwatching the misty horizon where Origin sank. Matthew stood in the middle, the others still alive to his right, and N to his left, each separated by a huge distance. His sword was still out of the scabbard.</p>
<p>After reminiscing for a while, sending those that can't be seen any more, Matthew diverted his attention, "Righty-ho... Wanna get back to it, then?" He prepared to fight with N, although without calling his blades.</p>
<p>"I highly doubt you have the strength left."</p>
<p>"Same goes for you." After all, his sword remained pointed at him, though none of them moved. In the far distance, light beams pierced through thick cumulonimbus clouds, as if angels were to return to 'Earth' from such beams.</p>
<p>Physical strength lost doesn't mean mouth strength lost, "Moebius will never change. In any way. Forever transfixed. They will guard the '<strong>endless</strong> now' to the last."</p>
<p>"Including you?"</p>
<p>"Naturally." And he tucked his sword back to the scabbard, seeing the fight won't continue.</p>
<p>He retreated his offense mode, "Well then, we'll be busy."</p>
<p>"What if you cannot make it happen? Your lives are <strong>pitifully</strong> short."</p>
<p>"<em>Heheh.</em> We went over this. <strong>You got wax</strong> in your ears? If I can't, someone else will, down the line." N looked at him and the others; nobody hesitated. He turned around and walked away, seeing no convincing will happen, calling back his mask. Then, Matthew continued, "<em>Who knows...</em>" It stopped him. "Maybe it'll even be <strong>you</strong>." He said nothing, teleported away.</p>
<p>The beam in the distance signified a new starting point; whatever the future lies ahead, this is the path they'd chosen, and that they'll walk down it, without regret.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside some coverings where rocks of pointed tips cover some of the sunlight above, the armories had parked and settled their new colony here. It seemed to be a temporary location, by the beach, and some armories even parked on the sea-part near the beach. Tents were set up. People were busy rebuilding the colony. City people, children, Nopons, all helped out; well, children plays. Cooking or what, they have to settle for communism temporarily{{footnote: When civilization starts small, before things become complicated, it <strong>always</strong> starts with communism, then gradually, people aren't happy of being in par with others, for Mother Nature wants competition; then people abandon communism and went for something more complicated -- monarchy, democracy, socialism, you name it. When war destroyed everything down to the ground, and by everything wipe out, one really mean <strong>everything</strong>, communism starts again, to rebuild the colonies. Those community that aren't wiped out during a war don't need to restart from communism.}}</p>
<p>"Cough cough..." There was an explosion at one of the places, but nobody reacted to it; they had already got used to it. After the smoke died down, Riku, standing beside the Ouroboros Stone, complaint, "<strong>Friend fail yet again! Did Riku not say? Should not use so much Noise Bite!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>WHUH?!!!</strong>" Nikol remembered he didn't heard that from him. "<strong>You said to throw in a bunch of them, you told me!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Riku did not!</strong>" Now the Ouroboros Stone was on smoke, they had to restart whatever they were doing. "<strong>Nikol must have poor hearing.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Eeeeerrrrrrmmmm...</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urhurg urhurg..." Glimmer walked into the scene, covering her eyes and nose, flapping away the smoke with another, towards Nikol. "Honest to spark... You're still going at it?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean 'still'? It has to be done! We're- powering up the Ouroboros Stone... Just about done with it now." That he and Riku, after the smoke gone dead, went back to work. Without looking, he took some thing, perhaps towel, from Glimmer naturally, continued, "We've accumulated all this data. Now if we could only encode it... in the operative photon wave frequency."</p>
<p>She went to the table at the side and slightly sit on it, get a cup for herself and drank the content while asking, "If you get it to work, we'll be able to deploy that power whenever we feel like it, right?"</p>
<p>"Right. I'll admit the photons have limited <strong>capacity</strong>, so we won't be able to empower... <strong>quite</strong> that many people all in one go..."</p>
<p>"Hmmm..." Something came into her head, why she was here in the first place. "Oh! More importantly, you <strong>don't</strong> wanna be late. The send-off?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Hurggghhhh!!!! OHH, THAT'S RIGHT!!!</strong>" Even Riku fluttered his wings as he was reminded. He immediately ran. Nikol took some time to stand up, "I better get moving!"</p>
<p>"Ahahaha!" And Glimmer went after him.</p>
<p>At the new entrance, Matthew was packing his little sack as luggage while the others were following behind. Na'el asked, "Take care, alright? You sure you're going to be fine alone?"</p>
<p>"Whoa, yeah! It'll be a relief if anything."</p>
<p>Glimmer: "<em>Well, someone's full of himself...</em>"</p>
<p>Nikol ran up beside him, "Matthew... Thank you... for everything."</p>
<p>"<em>Ahuh! And thanks right back atcha.</em>"</p>
<p>Reaching the entrance, he stopped and turned to the sending off group. "Also, while I'm gone, keep an eye on the City, eh? Na'el. Nikol. Glimmer. Panacea. Linka. Oh, <strong>and you,</strong> Riku."</p>
<p>"Why Riku last?"</p>
<p>"Ahahahaha!"</p>
<p>Na'el was insecurely looking down, seemingly her tears were gathering at the tip of her eyes. "Ungh..." Then, a huge hand rubbed her in her head. "<strong><em>Once I've found us some friends, I'll come home again.</em></strong>"{{footnote: Check the appendix for his status at the end of his life, what people said of him, encarved at his statue at the new City's memorial hall.}}</p>
<p>"<em>Mh hmm... Get back safe.</em>"</p>
<p>"Sure!" Turning without looking back, he shouted to the sky whom welcomed him a new journey, "<strong>Arrighty! Time to start REBUILDING the world. MATTHEW VANDHAM... is outta here!</strong>"</p>
