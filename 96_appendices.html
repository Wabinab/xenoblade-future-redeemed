<p><strong>Note from Translator:</strong> Here contains the affinity scenes which aren't included in the main video.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at the battlefield where the two Ferronises had fallen, after they saved Glimmer and Nikol, A commented, "'Moebius Hunters', hm? We seem to have earned ourselves <em>quite</em> the sobriquet..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Hahahah! Our reputation precedes us!</strong>"</p>
<p>"This is no laughing matter, Matthew. Taking Moebius head-on is <strong>extremely</strong> ill-advised. If they <strong>really</strong> brought their might to bear, I wouldn't rate our chances highly. <strong>Case in point</strong>, our <strong>previous</strong> encounter with that Kevesi colony. <strong>Get it, Matthew?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Oh, that? I mean</strong>, they came right at us and we gave 'em a flick on the nose, <strong>right?</strong>"</p>
<p>"You went at the colony with your <em>fists</em> and ended up destroying the whole Ferronis. And you call it a 'flick on the nose'? Really?"</p>
<p>"Uhh..."</p>
<hr />
<p>In Aurora Shelf, they were looking at the Great Sword piercing in the distance. The far view makes the sword's hilt looked far taller than the clouds. Even the night sky illuminated by starlight can't prevent a black silhouette from looming out there visibly.</p>
<p>"<strong>Check this out...</strong> Nice view of Cadensia's Great Sword from here too, huh..."</p>
<p>"Hmm... The way I hear it, it's hotly-contested territory for Keves and Agnus," shared A.</p>
<p>"Erm... I-I've heard so too," added Nikol. "There was some large-scale battle there, earlier..."</p>
<p>Matthew: "Sure, so it's like a... <strong>key</strong> position that the two Castles <strong>glare</strong> at each other over. Both Keves and Agnus must want what's there for some strategic reason, I guess."</p>
<p>"In every age, <em>the sword is the fulcrum of conflict</em>," says she whom traveled and knew the history for long.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside a tomb that looked majestic. Well, dark and gloomy, except the tomb that stood out. There was a hole opened that gave light to the chamber. Matthew asked, "Hello? What's this <strong>giant</strong> rock?"</p>
<p>"It's a sarcophagus, a stone coffin. Contained within is a body... Ah, a husk, I mean." explained she whom knew even longer history when husks don't evaporate into nothingness.</p>
<p>"A husk?" that's something new to Nikol.</p>
<p>"Are you serious? <strong>Isn't it a bit large</strong> for a single husk?"</p>
<p>"Nobody said it was for a 'human'."</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>Matthew, hearing so, was more afraid of the unknown than curious, "What say we leave it the <strong>hell</strong> alone."</p>
<hr />
<p>Also at Yesterdale, but the place used to be a village that had been burnt down to the ground. Despite, some pillars and structures survived the fire. Trees were dead, but their trunks remained. Ground remained untilled and no sight of plants growing despite looking abandoned for long. Near the place, there was a tree full of red leaves{{footnote: If you watched or read Xenoblade 3, it's the Saffronia.}}</p>
<p>"Matthew, <em>this place...</em>"</p>
<p>"Chyra's settlement," he immediately answered. "We were going to build a second City... Her family and others, came here to lay the groundwork."</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>"And now, there's not even a single City left <strong>anywhere... But I swear, I'll rebuild</strong> it one day. In memory of Grandad, and all the other fallen."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ah, right! I've been meaning to say this...</strong> for a while, but... <strong>Once the City's rebuilt</strong>, you'll come with, <em>won't you, A?</em> You know you'll always be welcome."</p>
<p>"That's, ah... Well, that sounds <em>good</em>, actually. I'll think it over."</p>
<hr />
<p>Still at Yesterdale, a place called Ferronis Crater, it was a huge crater with remnants of Ferronis laid bare, surrounded by lush green grass of plains and some bioluminescent-leaves trees, and there were higher platform that they could travel that surrounded the vicinity. This is the remnants where the battle with Moebius, Glimmer's last hope of return, had left after it was destroyed. Black fog was quite thick in the area. Near the crater, there was a fenced area where seemingly someone must still be living there, whoever they are. And behind the fenced area was a river running through the bank.</p>
<p>Glimmer: "Fusing a Kevesi and Agnian Ferronis together... This is inconceivable..."</p>
<p>Rex: "<em>I hear there's a Moebius... who researches Ferronis Flame Clocks,</em> developing experimental tech and what have you. Might be his handiwork that this was <em>based on.</em>"</p>
<p>Shulk: "Yeah... But you know what?"</p>
<p>Nikol: "No, what?"</p>
<p>"It must've taken a lot of engineering to make it work. <em>I'm really curious...</em> Wish we could bring it back for analysis..."</p>
<p>Rex: "Uh-oh... Here comes Shulk's <em>fatal weakness.</em>"</p>
<p>Nikol was equally excited: "<strong>I agree, Shulk, sir! I wanna study it too!</strong>"</p>
<p>Matthew: "<strong>Don't- encourage- him!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>At a building where wooden tiled floor was, inside the building in Colony 9. They were looking out at a window when Shulk sighed, "Ah..."{{footnote: 1st floor of Dunban's house.}}</p>
<p>"You all right, Shulk?" asked Matthew.</p>
<p>"Yeah... This house- is- where a <strong>friend</strong> of mine, used to live, once. He taught me a great many things; From swordsmanship, to life advice... Truly... He was incredible."</p>
<p>"Wow..."</p>
<p>Rex: "This the mentor you used to tell me about? <em>I wish I'd gotten to meet him as well.</em> Wait... was it <strong>your mentor</strong> or your brother-in-law?" It's a house by the entrance, immediately beside the bridge. Behind was a tent that stretched out from one side, allowing one to relax, watching the river flow below while enjoying the sun and stars. A tree grew at the corner to shade any extra heat.</p>
<p>Shulk immediately shot, "Ah no he was...! Well I mean y-y-... <strong>yes</strong>, I suppose, but..."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Matthew was confused.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the workshop where Riku placed the Ouroboros Stone, Matthew noted,"So <strong>you guys</strong> had the Ouroboros Stone that was <strong>from the City</strong>, then?" The place was filled with boxes and terminals, all kinds of equipment required to perform research. Although, the place was kinda a tent at the turn of the street, so it doesn't look like soundproof, eh.</p>
<p>Shulk agreed, "Yeah, some refugees fleeing the City entrusted it to us."</p>
<p>"My Grandad spent <strong>years</strong> studying that thing. He'd say it was more important than life itself."</p>
<p>"I see... So the research documents we got with the Stone, belonged to your grandfather?"</p>
<p>"<em>Ah well...</em> Without Grandad it's just a giant <strong>paperweight</strong>, anyway..."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Matthew. Riku and I will be more than happy to take over research on the Ouroboros Stone. I promise you, we won't let your grandfather's work go to waste."</p>
<p>"Right... Cheers for that, Shulk. I'm sure Grandad would be happy."</p>
<p>Rex: "Eh, and it's not like we're exactly, <strong>strangers</strong> to that thing, <strong>anyhow.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh? <strong>Oh really?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>It's been given to you by <strong>Nia</strong>, the Queen of Agnus, right?</em> Well then... It's got to be kept safe at <strong>all</strong> cost. No- matter- what."{{footnote: It reminds him of one of his wife, so...}}</p>
<p>Shulk: "<em>Rex...</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Crossing the bridge to the tower side of Colony 9, where there were levnises parked. On the platform, Matthew asked, "What's this? <strong>Ah, a couple of Armories!</strong>"</p>
<p>Glimmer asked, "'Armories'? You mean those Levnis-looking things?" They looked like six-legged insect that grabbed onto the ground, a torso where people could mount into, and some weapons attached to the torso, or perhaps it's the jet engine?</p>
<p>"Yeah, they're the City's mobile assault vehicles. They're fitted with a <strong>pretty- nifty-</strong> cloaking device."</p>
<p>Rex explained, "We got our hands on these particular bad boys after some Moebius lackeys shot them down."</p>
<p>Shulk added, "Sadly, the impact of the crash caused <strong>significant</strong> damage to several systems."</p>
<p>"*<em>Seriously?</em> Is that why they're still in pieces?"</p>
<p>Nikol was curious, "Can't you fix 'em?"</p>
<p>Shulk replied, "We've been trying, but they've been giving us some trouble."</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Where Matthew and Dillon first talked about Na'el the day after they arrived at Colony 9, overlooking the City from afar, and the lake surrounding it, and the waterfall that filled the lake from a much taller platform. The colony wasn't the only island on the lake, though. There was a Gotrock Oracle Ruins at the edge, seemingly water fall off to lower platforms from there, and some other larger island nearer to the colony.</p>
<p>Shulk reminisced, "This takes me back. I've always liked coming here... whenever I had to do some... serious thinking."</p>
<p>Nikol: "I can see this being a good place to focus. It's quiet, no people around..."</p>
<p>"Well... in my case... I'd often get <strong>so</strong> deep in thought, I'd forget to <strong>eat</strong> all day long."</p>
<p>"That's- <em>unexpected.</em> You seem very together, Shulk."</p>
<p>"Hah... If that is so, the credit goes to someone I've known all my life, who'd bring me food here.{{footnote: His wife, Fiora.}} She supported me through thick and thin. It's thanks to her I'm here today at all... That goes for you, too."</p>
<p>"W-what was that?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer him directly, his curiosity, said instead, "Hey, Nikol. Once things have settled down, let's come here again and talk properly. We can have sandwiches together, ones with special herbs and spices, eh?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, sure! That sounds nice."</p>
<hr />
<p>At Gotrock Oracle Ruins, they looked at the stairs and platform from afar. Rex ghostly startled her, "Glimmer."</p>
<p>"Wh-what is it all of a sudden?"</p>
<p>"A long time ago, I made a decision here. That no matter what it cost me, <em>if it's for the people that count on me...</em> if it's to live up to their trust, I'd walk through hell and high water, and gladly. So..."{{footnote: Unfortunately, the Translator can't recognize where this place was in Xenoblade 2.}}</p>
<p>"W-why are you telling me this?" A sudden confession, eh?</p>
<p>"<em>I just want you to know that you're never alone.</em>"</p>
<p>"Oookay? I-I'm not following." Makes her more confusing, eh!</p>
<p>"It's fine. Don't worry about it... I've said my piece. That's enough for me... I'm pretty sure that's what <em>she wants too.</em>"</p>
<p>"Ungh..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Climbing above a tall platform of the ruins in Black Mountains region, they were looking at a giant piece of soil and rock that loomed its silhouette far beyond their current location. Rex: "Over there, you're calling that landmass Urayan Mountains these days?"</p>
<p>Nikol answered, "Yes that's right, I think..."</p>
<p>"<em>Right, right... 'Mountains'...</em>"</p>
<p>Glimmer was curious, "Hm? You wanna say something?" The clouds were low compared to the Mountains that stretched even higher into the sky.</p>
<p>"<strong>Nah just...</strong> reminiscing a bit. One time, <em>I got swallowed up</em> by them. <em>That was one <strong>helluva</strong> ride</em>."</p>
<p>"Huh?" How did a mountain even swallow you? You went into its belly?</p>
<p>Matthew exclaimed, thinking he was kidding, "<strong>Damn, Rex, YOU'RE GOOD! You almost had me there for a sec.</strong>"</p>
<p>Nikol now get it, "<strong>Oh, a joke! I-I get it...</strong>"</p>
<p>Glimmer questioned his health status, "Hey, are you feeling OK? <em>Your head, specifically?</em>" She put her hands on his forehead.</p>
<p>How could they not believed him? "<strong>Hey, lay off me!</strong> <em>I guess it does kinda sound like a fever dream.</em>"{{footnote: If you watched Xenoblade 2, you'd know some City was built inside the stomach of that Urayan Titan.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>At the hall of a building in Prison Island. The buildings were so tall, perhaps 10 storeys, they looked like not built for human size. The staircase to the side were wide and big too, allowing for 3 horses to cross side by side, if horses can go up staircase. Along the center was a long alleyway that leads to some altar-looking place?</p>
<p>Matthew noted: "So the inside of Prison Island looks like some kinda ruin as well, huh."</p>
<p>Nikol don't like it: "It's... a really unpleasant place." The black fog shrouded their view a lot, making it damp and dark.</p>
<p>"Well, for a place called something like 'Prison Island',... it's at least pretty damn spacious, innit? Wonder what it was meant to imprison?"</p>
<p>"Hhhh..." It's not something Shulk want to recall.</p>
<p>Glimmer added, "And it's got those monsters, shrouded in black fog..."</p>
<p>A introduced, "Those, are Fogbeasts. Signs of the strained world the black fog birthed... And <strong>now</strong> servants of Alpha. But originally, something that had no place existing."</p>
<p>Matthew exclaimed, "I don't wanna stay here longer than I need to."</p>
<hr />
<p>On top of an icy platform on Black Mountains, a platform on Prison Island outdoors, there were chains shoulder high preventing them from falling over the ledge. Looking up from here, the tip of the prison island pierced high into the sky, as if into Origin. The view angle against the horizontal was around 80°, very steep indeed, and still long way to go.</p>
<p>Matthew: "Huhhh... Why d'you reckon it is? It's the first time I've ever seen Origin, but <em>it feels like I've already known it forever</em>..."</p>
<p>A: "You know, it might not be just your imagination." The Great Sword, though, the tip of its hilt reached the middle of Origin, where Origin is now floating.</p>
<p>"Huh? Whaddya mean, A?"</p>
<p>"The <strong>Blade</strong> <em>you wield</em>... Those are very special metal embedded within it. And that metal... is a shard of Origin."</p>
<p>"Wha-?! <strong>Are you sure?</strong> But Grandad <strong>gave</strong> me this..."</p>
<p>"Ever since you took up that Blade, your fate has been <strong>inextricably</strong> entwined with Origin."</p>
<p>"<em>Huhhh....</em>"</p>
<p>"And now finally... you stand at its threshold. <strong>This</strong>, is the time to unlock your destiny. <strong>Reach out</strong> and seize the future you desire, Matthew."</p>
<p>"Yeah... <strong>I'm gonna. We have to keep living</strong> in this world... And for that... Alpha's got to go."</p>
<p>"You'll have my help as well. It is for the sake of this moment... that I have traveled with you thus far."</p>
<p>"Thank you, A."</p>

<h2 id="description-of-them-thousands-of-years-later"><a class="header" href="#description-of-them-thousands-of-years-later">Description of them Thousands of years later</a></h2>
<p>These are encarved in the new city's memorial hall, where the "six founders" had their statues raised, and their descriptions are as below.</p>
<p>Nikol Ortiz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the founder of House Ortiz and the City's Liberator. A Kevesi soldier, this Founder was released from the Flame Clock system by the other Founders, and henceforth, spent every last ounce of his energy for the cause: to liberate the City as one of the first Ouroboros. With surpassing skill in mechanical engineering, the Founder fought not with a Blade, but with a weapon of his own fabrication. He was also responsible for laying the foundations of all the mechanical system supporting the City to this day. Following the fight against Moebius, he poured the remainder of his days into rebuilding the City, before finally perishing at the age of 80 years, though how he attained that feat despite his origins as a Kevesi soldier remains unexplained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shulk (Panacea Reid):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Reid and the City's Liberatrix. Rather than the Founder herself, this statue depicts the Founder's mentor figure, standing as a sign of the deep reverence and devotion she felt for her teacher. The founder's master was unconnected to her by bonds of blood yet he raised her as would befits child of one's own, it is said. Though of calm and constant disposition, the sight of him on the battlefield, great red sword in hand, struck fear into many a Moebius; and though the vicious struggle against Moebius cost this ferocious warrior his right arm, the loss did nothing to diminish his desire to hone his martial skills each day, standing as vivid testament to his indomitable will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Na'el Doyle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Doyle and the City's Liberatrix. Directly descended from those who established the first, original City. Her whereabouts were lost after N's ravaging of the City of old, but upon encountering the other Founders, she committed herself fully to the fight. This Founder is said to have a familial relation to the Founder of Vandham, with scant extant records suggesting they were likely brother and sister. She fought alongside the Founder of Vandham then, who was the elder of the two, and brought the power of Ouroboros to completion. Said to have been bright and wise, this Founder laid the cornerstones for much of the City's governance and legal systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matthew Vandham:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Vandham, and the City's Restorer and Liberator. THe original incarnation of the City was once laid to ruin by Moebius N's hand. The Founder realized fully the power of Ouroboros, heretofore limited, and fought against N, ousting him. Once victorious, he gathered the old City's people, scattered to the winds, and reestablished the City. With the City restored, he left its government in the hands of the Founder Doyle, and departed on a lonely expedition. <em>No records exist of his fate thereafter. Heirs of Vandham's lineage only returned to the new City several centuries later.</em> Oral tradition has it that the Founder was master of the classical art of fist fighting, and the scions of House Vandham carry on the custom to this day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rex (Linka Cassini):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Cassini and the City's Liberatrix. Much like with the Founder of Reid, this statue, too, depicts this Founder's respected mentor rather than the Founder herself. The mentor boasted a robust physique, wielding 2 great swords at once with utmost ease, and facing down Moebius despite the loss of one eye. He lived his life an unsophisticated sort, broad-minded but impassioned, and is said to have aided the Founders in the fight against Moebius, physically and spiritually. He was further reported to have been a free spirit, whose qualities influenced the other Founders, still young and impressible when the City was restored. Indelible proof of this rebellious spirit can be seen time and again in the ethos of the House in generations to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glimmer Rhodes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A soldier of Agnus, this Founder's fight to the death against the Founder of Ortiz, a soldier of Keves, was interrupted by a chance meeting with other Founders. Freed from the bondage of her Flame Clock, she joined the fight against Moebius. Although a soldier, the Founder is reported to have been exceedingly gentle and kind at heart. Additionally, her skill in the healing arts greatly contributed to the development of medical science in the City in later ages. And irrespective of starting life as an Agnian soldier, she is said to have surpassed 80 years of age, though the way she achieved that remains shrouded in mystery.</p>
