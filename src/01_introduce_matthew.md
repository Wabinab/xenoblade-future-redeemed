# The Place Where Everything Begins

===

Amidst the blazing blizzard{{footnote: Meaning, intense flames within blizzard.}} stood 3 figures against a flying figure. The flying figure expels an energy so intense it lit the surrounding, emitting flame speckles and black fog. It wielded the Monado{{footnote: The sword of the God. It has a red case with a beaming blade within it.}}, and had some spell drawings floating behind him{{footnote: Signifying that he's a God.}}. Of the 3 figures, one is floating mid-air, with long hair that reached his pelvis and two thorns on his head{{footnote: If you read Xenoblade 3, it's Z.}}; another was a short hair guy wielding another Monado, and the last buff guy wielded two-handed swords. 

"**WHY?!!! TELL ME WHY!!!**" He put a step forward, really angry at the flying figure. "**IS THIS... REALLY WHAT YOU WANT?!!! ALVIS!!!**" That was the guy wielding the Monado. He had sharp chin, cyan eyes, and quite long hair that cuts through his forehead and his nose, and both side of his chin. He wore a red-laced garment, short sleeved. 

"Drop it, **Shulk!**" The guy wielding the dual blade shouted at him. He also had sharp chin, light brown iris, and hair that stood up with applied gel, wearing some leather armor, with buff muscles. "Nothing's gonna get through to him! **He's a heartless machine!**"

"**WE HAVE TO TRY!!!**"

"Fascinating!" The last of the floating figure exclaimed. "Is this how badly you wish to erase us... my god?!" He had purple lightning-like scars on his chin. His thorn is flaming, like emitting smokes. His ears was pointed, like that of an elf. 

Alvis spoke nothing, emitting more energy, energy so strong it pushes the three back as they tried to defend themselves. "**ARRRRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!**"

Against the morning sky, clouds shrouded the land. Only a few tall land pierced through the clouds, showing figures that represent various form of beasts. To start our story, we'll take you to one of the 'island' that had an arch over it. It's relatively small compared to the other beasts, but even so, 'small' is relative. 

As we zoomed into the arc, immediately below it is a metal bridge so tall that it leads to another region. Below the bridge was some floating lily-leaves like island that had stems sticking it high above the lake below it. Further down the edge of the lake were lush green plains that was home to many animals. As we followed the canyon to the other side, the 'opened' side not surrounded by rocks, we see more trees, including one with red leaves. And let's not miss the remnants of some abandoned civilization. Further down, there was another crevasse with browner grass. And from one of the creeks was a hole that took us into an environment totally occupied by autumn trees and autumn grass, some reindeer with red and black stripes, other bugs, and our main location. 

Explosion, explosion, explosion. Some monster was running after a figure dressed leather black with inner red. He was huffing and puffing, peering over his shoulder to see where these guys were. "Huh huh huh **Arrrgggh...**" He managed to jump in time to dodge a blast, and the girl behind him jumped, dodged another blast. But unlike him, she was cool, don't even pant. 

"**Errggghhhh**" the gloves on his hand started transforming into a weapon, and he punched the spider-like figure, with metallic body and several tentacles stretching from its head. By Newton's 3rd law, he was repelled back before landing in front of the figure. He had sharp chin, slightly-tanned skin, bright turquoise iris, slightly sharp ears, and tied his hair behind him. "Tough little so-and-so! Can't even seem to **Break** it!"

"I told you we should've left alone." He peered over his shoulder where she close in on him, "But you had to stick your oar in, didn't you?" She had dark turquoise big iris, lesser pointed chin, small nose, some ears, and her left ear had an earring that hung a Cross-like ruby jewel{{footnote: If you watched Xenoblade 2, you'd know that was similar to the one on Pyra/Mythra's chest.}}, wore some ocean-blue shirt, long slightly-gray lower garment, and wielded a red sword. "**Matthew.**"

"**Hurgggg**" And the two dodged another attack from the monster. 

"Lecture me later, **A**! Aight? First things first!"

She exasperately snorted, "Huh... You're impossible..." And they prepared to fight.
