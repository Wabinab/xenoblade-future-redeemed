# History & The Promised World

Grandad was leisurely returning home along a grassy path one night, when he stopped and saw something off in the distance. "Hmm?" What is it that was off, he asked himself. Then, the floor shook, a mushroom flaming clouds behind the cliff brightened the sky. Quickly, he dashed along the rights of way, hoping his return would not be too late. The familiar path did not require his eyes; his eyes fixated on the continuous explosion. Something was off, something... that don't look like an explosion. "What's that... strange pillar of light...?" An orange beam straight up into the sky. No time to guess, he'll know when he get back to the City. 

Fallen fragments and burning rubble, he had to make it to the center, the pillar of light guide his way. Only frequent explosions in his rights of way slowed him down, till one last stop and he found out. Within the giant pillar of light, the of the City stood emotionless within, indifferent to their home getting destroyed. Na'el, standing on the front row, heard his footsteps getting near, tilted her head; the others robotically followed in sync with her actions. Grandad saw her opened her arms, walking out of the beam, enchantingly said, "Come. Enter the circle, quickly. It's just you and Matthew now."

"Na'el? What're you...?" An explosion shook him out of focus and balance; he hadn't made sense of what had happened to them yet. "Hmm?" Looked around, secondary spider-like Moebius marched towards the beam, led by N. "Huh!" Without mask, Grandad easily recognized the one he'd not seen for eons. With trembling voice, he can't believe, "You-... Are you..." 

> N, Noah, as he turned into golden motes, spoke to him when he was still a child, his eyes full of hope for his child's future. 

"Father...?"

Matthew was late. He was still on his way, panting heavily along the road crossed by Grandad. Heavy sooty smokes and flaming speckles filled the air he breathed in, scorching his lungs; but he cannot stop now. He had to get to where the pillar of light is. But he did stop, seeing the City that reared him for the past 15 years came crashing down. There was nothing more painful than the loss of one's home sweet home{{footnote: At least in that moment.}}. 

Secondary spider-like Moebius continued to roam the land, searching for any living beings that had not yet turned to light. The shirt and helmet remains laid on the ground, flattened as their flesh returned to Mother Earth, nowhere any longer. 

Grandad was in disbelieve, questioned, "_Why are you doing this?_"

"_Hmm..._" Feeling queasy. 

"But you told me _yourself_... You told me to make friends... " The last words before he disappeared when he was still a child still ringing in his ears. "**Say** something!"

Na'el, or either, Alpha, cut in and influenced, jumped to conclusion, "He doesn't want us here. We're a nuisance."

"**Nuisance?**"

"Right? _You_ who've become _Moebius_. N... Isn't _that your name?_"

"You... **Who are you? What've you done to Na'el?**" His granddaughter wouldn't had known such secrets so easily. This is not her granddaughter. 

Bickering each other isn't a strategy restricted to Alpha, and N answered him, "It's name is Alpha. An entity that wishes to **erase** this world."

"Huh?" 

"He's wrong." Alpha rebutted. Putting her hands on her heart, she said, "I want to embark on a journey to the future. There's **just** the matter of unwanted baggage."

"What're you **talking** about?"

"Lives." N answered. 

"_Huh..._ We Moebius, and... every last **soldier** on the face of this world."

"_I... What are...? And that's why, all this?_" He got more confused with the reasonings of both side. 

And she took it as a proof, "See? We don't **need** them."

"I will... _I will arrest it._" He put back his mask, continued, "This moment. **This instant!**" He put his hand on his sword. Alpha summoned her blade and ready to fight. 

---



He dashed backwards, then dashed quickly back at Alpha; she had no fight for him, his speed was too quick for her to do anything else than defend, "You're just Moebius... But... what's this power...?!"

"**You would never understand. This is... MY CHOICE!**" He tucked his sword back to its scabbard, and one slice broke her blade. Just before the sword pierce into her chest, she resummoned her blade and aimed a beam at the ground, using Newton's law to dodge such attacks. Later, she spit flames at him. But to no avail; her speed are too slow to hit him. No, not even suppressing fire. 

"So you choose to stay in the now? To abandon the future?!"

"**The one leaving things behind... IS YOU!!!**"

"Urgggghhhaaaahhh!!! Unggghhhhh..." She rolled and rolled on the ground, losing balance, having difficulty standing up. In a pleasing tone, she asked, "_Grandad, help... Please help..._"

"_Na'el..._" While they were fighting, he had time to think, to absorb the new information he'd just known, and to make up his choice, not joining. 

"It is done, Alpha." One more time he stuck his sword back to the scabbard, to gather the chi into one single slash. 

No time for Grandad to think as he saw him already dashing towards her; "**Leave her!**" He ran in between and caught his blade with his body. 

"**Ngh!**" N was inherently surprised; he hadn't came for this. He didn't continue thrusting deeper. 

"Na'el is... She's your family..." He peered over his shoulder, saw Alpha slowly getting on her feet, continued. "I can't let you do this..."

"_Ngh..._"

"What about Mum?"

"_Haaaa..._"

"Did **she**... want this too?"

"_You don't need to know. The burden is... mine alone to bear._" Not to mention her, his voice became depressing. Gripping tighter by the hilt, blood dripped off his son's chest with greater thrusting force. 

"_Huh huhhh... Mum would... tell you... to let it go, I'm sure... I know it... But you... you can't choose... this path..._"

"_Ghondor..._" 

Matthew had been late into the party. "Huh huh huh huh **Na'el! GRANDAD! HUUUUU!!!**"

No time left. He cannot let Matthew came near. Ghondor told his dad, "This is the path... I have chosen." N gritted his fist and teeth more stronger. He won't let go. Then, spoke to "Matthew..."

"**Grandad!**" He dashed towards him, trying to save him, while waving away the black soot that blocked his view. 

"Take care of... Na'el... the future..." He was too late. The bright Ouroboros power had glowed strong in his chest, his speech quicken, his soul escaping his body. 

"**GRANDAD!!!**" 

"It's in your hands, Matthew!" And the explosion blew him away, shining so brightly that even the night turned into day. At his last moments, his soul flew towards Na'el's forehead, trying to shake out whoever is occupying his granddaughter's body. She cannot react. N, Matthew, and the others braced for impact. 

"**HUUURRRAAAAGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!**"

After the explosion, N stood alone   amidst burning rubble. All buildings had been destroyed with the self-explosion his son led. He stood there, without his mask, speechless and emotionless. 

M, Mio, who now became Moebius in silver armor,{{footnote: and just woken up, if you get the gist of it from Xenoblade 3 main story.}} teleported behind him, watched the desolated state with shaken heart. She looked at N's back; the final light in N's iris dimmed to depress. 

---

Matthew's fist was still in contact with N's sword. As the Ouroboros power dimmed down, they split, weakened by an immense loss of energy withdrew to replay history. N stayed on the ground, Matthew took to his feet. "What was that? Just now?" asked Glimmer.

"A memory from Origin," explained A. "The clash between Matthew and N afforded us a glimpse of it. This is how N **truly** felt." 

Nikol: "That's some history. I can't imagine..."

"_Huh..._"

"The people who are of the City..." said he as he stood up, "are the future of this world. Huurrrgghhh..." He looked up at Origin. "And in Alpha's eyes,... they are a crucial source of power."

"So you killed them all... Killed Grandad..."

"It was Ghondor's **choice**. I simply _cut him down, as he desired._"

"**Hurrr**ghhh..." He clenched his fist tight. "**STOP TAKING THE PISS!!!**" He dashed towards him and grabbed him by his shoulder, looked at his eyes, "**GRANDAD WOULDN'T... HE'D NEVER SIDE WITH THE LIKES OF YOU!!! 'THE FUTURE'S IN MY HANDS?' THAT CAN'T- BE- WHAT HE MEANT!!!**"

"_Hmph..._"

He dropped his head lower, eyes closed. "_You don't even see it..._" He sheathed his blade, asked philosophically, "**Are you really... THAT. MUCH. OF. AN. IDIOT!!!**" And punched him in his face. He didn't defend. 

"**Huh!**" A was shocked. 

"It's not just us, you know... It's your arse as well! **It's all of that, and more, that he meant... And if YOU CAN'T GET THAT into your head, you're about the DUMBEST BASTARD THERE IS.**" 

N laid there, legs knelt on the ground, motionless and emotionless, letting him scold. 

"_Matthew..._"

"Let's go. **I don't have time for his idiocy.**"

"Y-You're gonna leave him?!" Glimmer didn't see the gray in the black and white. "He's _Moebius_!"

He stopped, replied, "If he tries a stunt like that again, I'll just sock him another one. This was a _family matter_, through and through. End of story." 

But someone didn't gave him a choice. Before they could react, an orange beam, the power of Alpha, shot down from Origin and strike N. "**ARRRRGGGGHHHH!!**"

"**What?!!!**" Rex was equally shocked. 

"**N!!!**"

They looked up and saw Alpha Na'el floating up in the sky, "I've been waiting, brother dear." And they released an energy so thick like those faced by Z, Shulk, and Rex at the start of the chapter. 

"**ARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!**"

A huge house with porch, double storey, green roofing, and wooden-tiled floorings. Outside it laid cut grass, moved lawn. Trees were planted by the sides for decorations. There were houses of similar size or smaller separating each other, forming a community, separated by gates cut out of bushes and streets. The radio tone loomed in the background, as if the voice appeared in their heads wherever they go. The radio was placed on a table in the porch of that particular house we just described. 

(From here onwards, anything in comments like below will be speeches from the radio.)

> _Good afternoon, this is 11 News. Wednesday, May 16th. Weather in the Rhadamanthus Authority, is fair. It is 24 degrees centigrade, 56% humidity._

On a mowed lawn at another place, surrounded by metal gate, on a hilly top, Na'el stood alone, looking at the city far away. Buildings and houses built so close to each other, some tall, some short, as compressed as New York or the equivalent city of high density. On the very far side was a huge tower structure with a huge base, its 'pointed tip' with some rings on it reached much much taller than other buildings; not even skyscrapers could describe it -- the space lift{{footnote: One guessed this, because it goes directly up to reach space, and one can't think of any other structure.}}. Such structure was built on sea, for it's located at some distance outside the City's sea boundary. 

Na'el was peacefully watching, wearing her normal light-brown jacket with inner Tees. No signs of Alpha's power emanating from her. All was peaceful. 

> _Continuing yesterday's placid highs, the day promises to be pleasant. Today's news will be delivered by me, Sienna Morgan, with additional analysis by our political correspondent, Barry Crow Li._

---

His hands was still raised to protect from the light Na'el sent at him, found himself teleported under a morning sun, peaceful weather. With the others beside him, he looked around. Lamp post, street lights, houses, streets, pavement walks, trees, grasses, fire hydrants{{footnote: green, not red (in color).}} except there was nobody standing near. To the far side of where he was looking behind the trees was a step-up pavement towards the gated ledge. 

The others equally scanned the surroundings. Some were fancied by the white wooden gates that provide no defense other than decorations; The houses with large windows and double storey, but no signs of cars and other objects. Trees, potted plants laid outside along the porch and building walls. Behind such red houses was a tall hill. Some other building that are equally tall but have huge doors, perhaps a community hall? Or maybe a Church? These buildings and houses so far described have chimneys on them. 

A squinted as she looked around, unlike others in awe. 

"Where's this?" asked Matthew. 

---

Then, they started walking around, particularly towards the gated ledge. Matthew: "Whoa. What's all this supposed to be?"

A: "Hmm..."

Nikol: "What is this place, seriously...?"

Shulk: "I don't know... But it looks like there's a path at least."

Glimmer immediately suggested, "Then let's follow it... _No point in hanging around here..._"

Rex warned, "Be careful. Place as strange as **this**, anything at all could happen."

The guys finally reached the gated ledge that overlooked the crowded city below; not the same place where Na'el stood before. They had their first view of the city below, though one could only see buildings and some open fields (like football or what fields), and some strange structures of circle buildings, perhaps for some high-tech vehicles' port/station that people could walk inside to have themselves transport around the city? 

"Pretty..." commented Glimmer. "I've never seen anything like this."

"Wow. Those towers..." noted Nikol. "It's like they're all... sparkling..."{{footnote: That's due to the shiny surface and the reflection of the sun, by the way.}}

Panacea: "And that enormous one..."{{footnote: Talking about the space lift.}}

Linka stretched her head to max angle, but still can't see the top of it, "It's so huge... Bigger than a Castle."

"Hmm..." He had already thought of some things, being lived longer than most of them here except the few companions. 

Rex nudged, "_Shulk. This what I think it is?_"

"Yeah. The source of us all... Zanza... no, Klaus's world."

"_Before the fall..._"

"Mm..." he nodded. 

"What was that about the world?" asked Matthew.{{footnote: He heard of this before, but only 'heard' but not 'experienced' it so deep that he knew them by heart, so he probably didn't get immediately reminded about when Shulk and Rex told him after the 'confession' earlier.}}

Shulk explained, "Before mine and Rex's worlds came to be, everything was one. And this is that place."

"Ermmmmmm..." He tried to recall. "What you said, at the base. About the two- worlds, before they- came together... **This** was even further back than those ones?"

Rex: "_The lad's got brawn and brains. I'm impressed._"

"So what, we've traveled back **into** the past then?"

"No not really." thought Shulk. "This is Origin's memory stage. We- were- directly underneath it."

"Yeah." agreed Rex. "I think we're probably... inside of it now."

Glimmer tried to understand, "Meaning... _we're inside someone's memories?_"

A: "Of all the people who could remember this era, only one's left."

Rex: "_Alpha, eh? But what's the point of him showing us all this?_ Is it really Alpha that's doing this? Or is it... _Hmm?_" He turned around as he heard piano playing in the background. The rest followed glance. It was behind some trees. 

Matthew noted, "Piano? This- melody..." Exactly the ones he heard when Na'el was playing back at the City before its destroyed. The upright piano{{footnote: Old-style non-electric piano had 2 main types, the 'grand' ones, and the 'upright' ones.}} was placed in front of some bookshelf, the evening sun shining through the window on her left. "Huhhh..." He immediately dashed towards its source, finding road to it. The path and the staircase was just along the gates, and he ran there himself. 

---

Someone was playing behind the white mini-grand piano placed on the lawn. Tiles had been installed to withstand the weight of it. He took a walk closer to the side, to see her face. "**Na'el...!**" He immediately recognized, called out, but she was in her melody, too into the 'flow state' she cannot exit. 

His voice registered a tad bit later. "Huh?" Wondering who was it, she looked up, elatedly called out, "**Matthew! Welcome! I was waiting for you!**" She jumped from her seat, reached out for the one whom came to join her, she guessed. 

Meanwhile, the radio by the porch continued its news reporting. A jug of water and some plastic cups, or glass cups, and some desserts, had been placed at the round table beside the radio. 

> _Well Barry, don't you think this weather we're having is just perfect?_
> 
> _I do. I think the spotless sky today will make it easy for us all to celebrate last night's momentous occasion._

"Na'el... How- come- you're-..."

Still elated, she asked, "**It's such a wonderful place, isn't it? I've always dreamed of this. A place we could live together. A place... to call home. And not just for you and me, but for everyone we know.**"

> _Well then, let's talk more about that. Most of our listeners know what we're talking about, but we'll recap for any latecomers. At midnight on the sixteenth, the first Rhadamanthus Spaceport saw the launch of Earthlife Colonization Project's{{footnote: Check out Xenoblade X for more details! And yes, by the time of writing, the definitive edition is about to come out next month!}} eighth mothership, the Icarus, taking 480, 000 settlers to the Eta Carinae Nebula in the Carina-Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way. The Icarus is the eighth interstellar colony ship dispatched as part of Project Exodus, bringing the total number of colonists sent out to the stars to 3 million. The Coalition government plans to send out ships nine to thirteen in the course of this year. The ninth vessel, departing in July, heralds a new generation of ultra-long range colony ships, known officially as Philadelphia-class motherships. Each vessel boasts a capacity of up to 1.5 million people, meaning that if all goes to plan, the project will send a total of 10 million people out into the great beyond._ {{footnote: While we aggregated everything into one big chunk, you should treat it as speaking in the background while all the events took place concurrently.}}

"Every- who?" He's sure he didn't saw anyone except for him; but the moment he looked to his right, children were running and playing and waving and greeting, enjoying their life. "Uh... **When did they?**" There was a creepy feeling by the gate: where had those whom joined him gone? Did they not ran after him?

"Hey, Miss!" One of the child called out to Na'el, attracting Matthew's attention too. "I'm huuunnnngrryyyy!!!" He turned and saw the children waving at them. 

"**Can we have a snack?**" As the girl standing beside the first boy. 

"**OK!!!**" replied Na'el happily as ever, like she always did to the children of the City. Then, she gave rules, "All right, wash your hands first, and then make a line. Because today... I've made something **extra special**."

"**HURRRAYYYYY!!!**" chanted all the children. Immediately, they dashed off, and the two had some time for themselves for the moment. 

Na'el went to prepare the food while Matthew's eyes were still on the children. He followed thereafter. While she get the life she'd always wanted, he was more curious; but willing to not reject immediately, instead see for himself how events turned out. 

By the roundtable where the radio and foods were, a wooden tray with muffins and bread and biscuits were placed. Cups with red liquid were poured out. "There's plenty to go around. Just let me know if you want seconds." She took it and handed it to the vibrating children. 

"Hrrrgghhh..." He can feel her happiness, her dream, her relaxation. He didn't joined in; she'd always been the one to handle the children. Before was. Today is. But there was a thud. Without the promise of the real world, she resorted to live in her dreams. A dream she does not want to wake up from. He, however, had battles yet to fight, even if this is what she wants. 

Clearing the tray, the kids went away; she put it back on the table. 

> _Now for our next story. It concerns the 'Saviorite' Human Rights Protection bill, brought to congress last summer. Earlier today, we heard the 13 Authorities have petitioned against the proposal, and as the Justice Ministry's 7th Special Commission on Human Rights debates once more on its validity, the possibility that the proposal may be scrapped seems more and more likely. The proposed measure has sparked a lot of public debate, so many will be watching the government and the commission very closely._ 
> 
> _There was much apprehension about the bill failing to make it all the way through the legislative process. And indeed, that seems to be exactly what's happening right now._

Daylight turned quickly with a snap, and the evening sun shot over the horizon. The redness at the far end reflected off the shiny surface of the taller buildings facing an angle to where they watched. The children, active as ever, do not feel guilty playing whole day long{{footnote: instead of putting into 'useful', 'productive' work}}. His eyes fixated on her, walking back to beside him, told him,

"See? Isn't this great? There's no room for woes or worries here. Nothing to ruin our happiness. Out there... there's a world like **this** waiting. A place for new lives to live as they please. _Just like this._" 

Is it true? Can we humans really get rid of our woes or worries? Should we not, when we're rid of worries, invent new ones ourselves? For without worries, how are we to feel pleasure? Surely we need some baseline to compare to. 

"_Na'el. You can't-..._"

"It was promised to me. **By him!**"

"'Him'?"

"Mmm... The person with the silver hair and kind eyes." The gratefulness in her tone, he felt uneasy about it. He had seen what he did to her; he had heard his goals and beliefs; but this is her say, not his. She continued, "He gave us this **beautiful** world. He said if we simply cast away the old lives..."

> _And now, Dimitri Yuriev, councilperson from the Minos Authority, has issued a statement concerning the matter at hand. Please stay with us._

Can the old lives really be simply casted away? Is that even a choice one can make? What happened to our identity therefore? Say, any of you easily accept a reformed prisoner as a friend, to bring them out, to accept them, to respect them, so they don't need to do things that put them back into trouble? 

"We can set out, unburdened, and **all this** can be ours. _You see?_" And her tone turned harsh, "_We don't need any of this... old life..._" A shiver run down the skin. The background quiet to a stop after the flock of birds left the tree to the right. Is she beyond convince? Can he really reach out for her hearts, so deep, so cold? He felt he understood her, but he does not agree. Yet, he's not in the best place to open his mouth; any words might disrupt their already icy-point relationship to the point of no return. He's just there, within arms reach. He could hold on to her. But her hearts is far flung, across the ocean. The utopia she had decided to repeat forever, what can he do to wake her up? 

"Certainly, it's beautiful." He hadn't yet came up with a carefully-prepared wordings before A sounded, and he saw the rest of the group entered through the gates. "If it could truly stay this way..."

"**Hurrrghuuuhhh!!!**" The words ring true, but she dare not guess. 

"Na'el... Don't you know what came after? Have you ever seen it?"

"Mmphhhhh..." She dropped her head, unable to face herself. 

"Weren't you ever... curious?"

She looked away. 

"I think you suspect **already**. How it changed. What **became** of this world." 

Her eyes fluttered, but she didn't stop her. 

"And... how people have **always** been..." 

She closed her eyes, looked out again. No more children. No other sound. No wind. This was the peace before the storm. "**Huhhhh!!!**" She started walking towards the gates. 

A continued, "**_Ambition leads to pride._** **Even** when they'd been granted *limitless* freedom, **even** having built the *perfect* world for themselves, humans yet desired the 'beyond'."

> On the space port or space station where Klaus's experiment lab were, there were space fighter jets around it fighting each other, shooting each other down. Some were not fighter jets but mechanoid robots that were built for destruction{{footnote: Pneuma once called it for help in Xenoblade 2. Check it out!}}, slicing the jets to pieces like knife cutting through tofu. 

"And then, the world became the way it is now." In the flick of her thoughts, thunder strikes. Tornadoes formed, engulfing the city in the distance. The thick cumulonimbus clouds covered the entire sky; no other light except the redness at the horizon could still be seen. Rain fell heavily, dripping wet their shirts and plants and wash the piano. Her quivering eyes could not believe the calmness of promised life turned into turbulent stormy seas, where sailors faced uncertainty every day, not sure when their boat would topple. 

"**LIES! This is all, LIES!**" She snapped at A, "Don't think your ludicrous stories are going to change my mind! **Alpha**, he made me, an **inviolable** promise. **He said, this is what awaits us at the end of our road. He said we could make a world like this!**"

"Oh come off it!" Matthew called the bluff. "**Really? You think that?**"

"**Of course I do!**" she retorted, jumping to the conclusion in a split second. "**Everything that we were denied is right here for us!**"

"**IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SCAM!!!**"

"Ugh..."

"**WHEREVER YOU GO, IT'S THE SAME!!! YOU LEAVE 'THEM', IT ONLY ENDS ONE WAY.**"

She desperately argued back, "**Oh, so we should just let them keep killing each other! Killing, to live?! What a load of CRAP!!! Good riddance to ANYTHING THOSE 'BUTCHERS' WANT TO SAVE!!!**" She looked away, unwilling to face him; she saw the reflection of the other side of her on his face, trying to shake her beliefs. She could not as easily shut her ears. 

"**They're not 'things'!!! They're lives!**"

"Huhuhhh!!" That struck a chord. 

"And yeah, I can't forgive Moebius either. **Reaping lives** like grain during harvest... But come on... **What crime have their VICTIMS ever committed? WHAT DID THEY DO???** They weren't given a _single choice._ They were just trying to make the most of _each_ moment, like us!"

"Ngh..." Nikol and Glimmer's can relate to what he'd just said. 

"**Everyone you know DIED for that! Are you OK with that, Matthew?!**"

The remain of Chyra's corpses evaporated before her hands. The lifeless corpses that'd long gone, only their belongings placed a human shape on the ground, in the raging fire the day the City fell. "**COURSE I'M BLOODY NOT!!!**"

"Ungh huh!"

"Truth is... What you're talking about of doing, would make _you_ **exactly** the same as Moebius."

"Ugh!"

"**Exactly** the same! **If you build a new world on that foundation, it'll only end one way. LIKE THIS!!!**" No longer were they shiny; the heavy torrential rain had ran on for too long, making pillars brittle. Some would soon collapse under its own weight. 

"**THIS HERE?! AND THIS IS THE FUTURE YOU WANT?!**" Her irises in REM state, fighting against both side of herself as Matthew threw in logs and coals and fire to help the other side of her. 

"You see, Na'el? The lives that you and I have... You know that's a possible future for **all** the soldiers, right?" And he reached out for his pocket and took out the picture of Noah and Mio and his Grandad, showed it to her. "If it weren't for those guys, _we wouldn't even be here._ Don't lose sight of the real enemy. You know who it is. Moebius, or Alpha... It doesn't matter what you call 'em. The real enemy's whoever threatens our lives... Whoever tries to rob us of our hopes and dreams."

As she spoke, his voice in the background, his focused on Noah and Mio and their grandad; they were the first generation that liberated, together with their friends, and built the first City. Without the City, she wouldn't have 15 years of peace, and the plethora of children she'd grown up with, took care of, shielded under her. No, all would be chained in the unending warring state; none would had escaped the flow. 

He invited, "_Let's build a future, Na'el._ The one our elders wanted... with our own hands! C'mon. What do you say?"

She looked up and saw him handling over his hand. Would he had reached her? 

"_Matthew..._" Tears at the tip of her eyes, she slowly reached for his palm with her right hand, the left caught hold of the picture of hope. His reasoning is sound, his emotions were tight. An empty promises cannot fight a strong foundation built with their own hands. The future might be far; she might not lived to see it; but hey, at least hope was there. We can become a good ancestor to our fellow offspring. 

But someone doesn't want her to get back to his laps. "Urrrghhuhhh!!!"

He could only watched in awe, "**NA'EL!!!**" The bright beam blazed behind her, sucked her closer and closer towards the beam like a spider going down a vacuum cleaner; and he could not do anything about it. 

Hands holding out but cannot reach, she cried, "**MA-... MATTHEW!!!**" Before disappearing into the pillar of light. 

He stumbled a few steps forward, trying to reach out for her. The strong energy washed all paints of memories away into sparkles. The true metallic floor had been revealed; and indeed, they were now inside Origin. Alpha's suit had been automatically wore on Na'el; she was rendered unconscious, held mid-air as if a cross had pinned her down like it had pinned Jesus thousands of years ago. 

"What a farce. Your rhetoric is rife with falsehoods." Above Na'el, space broke open like it was 2D, forming an eye-like void which emits light and black fog. Alpha, in his own form, wielding his Monado, once again, appeared before the group. Except, the god's wing he had that floats behind him like butterfly wings, now only had its right side, "I cannot stand such drivel."

"Alpha..."

"I safeguard this world, by removing what is timeworn. But it seems that you continue to contravene me. You **spur** these **olden** mortals to action."

"I am your conscience."

"'Conscience'? Ahah... There is no place for it in the Trinity Processor."

Rex: "It's you there's no place for... Alpha. 'Cause Klaus... He entrusted the future to us. So he could atone for his past. **He followed** his conscience."

"And he failed to realize that his '_conscience_' led him astray. An atavistic delusion. It is **common** among the old. **Wholly unnecessary** for all subsequent life."

Matthew: "_I knew it..._ Of course that would be your vision of the world." He then point his index finger at him, "As long as there's **people** like you, nothing's ever going to change. Casting off the old world, and its people, and just **walking** away."

"You could not comprehend it, Matthew."

He paused for more than 3 seconds, before rebutting, putting down his finger, "Turning around, going back... Looking for a new way forward... Doing that time and again, that's how you build a future. _Eh, but you're just an obsolete piece of scrap, so_ no wonder you don't get it!"

"You said I am **obsolete**?"

He turned to A, whose eyes charmed, nodded back with a thin smile. "_Life is on our side._ And since there's none in you... **You're destined for the scrap heat!**"

A: "Let's do this, Matthew. Time to bring things to an end!"
