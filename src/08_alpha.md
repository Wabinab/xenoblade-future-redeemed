# Alpha

The Great Sword loomed high in the sky not far away. Where they are, the two rocks to both side of the entrance, large greenish-copper crystals grew. Trees anchored their roots into the cliffs. The City people seemed to be searching for something, spreading out at the field overgrown by grass knee-high. While they were busy, Matthew's eyes found Na'el by the beach herself, overlooking the gulf where seawater joined. She pulled up her sleeve, revealing the wristband she wore, unsure where's her mind on. 

Matthew approached her, wanted to converse, but were disturbed by some abhorrent wolf creatures emitting black smoke, its skin surface scorched with lava-like flames. Step by step they took towards them. Matthew first noticed; Na'el's was still daydreaming and reacted slightly later. Eventually, they summoned their blades and prepared for battle. 

---

Ouroboros power emanated from them, the creatures were down. "Are you all right? Na'el?"

She looked away, blandly replied, "I'm fine."

"_Huh..._" She still haven't walked out of the shadow, huh. Not sure how to deal with that now, he turned his attention to the creatures, questioned, "What were those things all about? They were giving me Moebius scrab vibes, but they weren't the same." As they spoke, the creatures evaporated into dust{{footnote: NOT motes.}}. 

"**Matthew! What happened?**" Some City fellows alerted ran after them. 

The leading fellow was a short-brown-haired guy. "Ah, hey Oren. It's fine. We're all good."

"Was it Moebius?"

"Nah... Some... new kinda breed of monster. Took 'em down, and they vanished into **thin** air."

"**Don't scare me like that! I thought... since you used the Ouroboros power, it had to be Moebius.**"

One of his accompaniments wearing poison-gas mask rebut, "C'mon, that's crazy talk. It's been like fifteen years since we last **tussled** with Moebius."{{footnote: Too long time of peace really is not good for us, eh! Makes us decadent. We need constant war to keep vigilant.}}

"Yeah, I suppose so..."

Matthew changed the subject to their target here, "How're we for ether?"

The poison-mask guy took it out from his pocket, "See for yourself." A full canister of bioluminescent ether. 

"Right on. So it looks like we've met the quota. Shall we head?"

"Mm." Both agreed. 

"Na'el?" He saw her looking at the other side, heartlessly answered,

"Mm." Still, she don't forgive me, huh... And he walked away biting his lips for a while. Na'el waited for them to walked a little longer before turning to follow up. While she was following, something shiny by the beach stood out at the tip of her eyes. Something... red. "Hm?"

Curious, she approached the object. It was Ontos's core. The 'red blood cells' within it flowed in a clockwise motion, giving it an appealing red. She picked it up, observed, and some voice rung in her ears: 

"_Let us away... Towards a new world... Out with the old. And in once more, with the new..._"

"Hrrr huuuh!" Is that not her wish? Is that not what she wanted the most right now? The world of peace, where there would be no war? The crystal appealed so much to her her eyes stretched to its limit as if it were going to break. Her vibrating iris revealed her shaken heart. Can she? Can she really? 

"Na'el." 

"**Huh!**" The voice of Matthew had brought him back to the present moment. Still holding the crystal by her hand, she saw Matthew and the others had turned back, seeing she hadn't caught up with them, at a distance away. "What's the matter with you? **Shake a leg!**"

It's not time to reveal that crystal yet. Calmly tucked it into the pocket of her coat, she tried her best to keep being 'normal', "_Uh, sorry... Coming_." Together, they went off into the distance. 

While they were on their way home, "Mm..." her thoughts lingered on the voices she heard. 

"Na'el. What were you up to back there?"

"Huh?" That brought her attention out of her daydreams. 

"You were... kinda... spaced-out."

"_Not really. Huuuuuhhh..._" Can she speak of the heavy rocks that is currently crushing her heart? With enough courage and internal urges, she called,  "Matthew..."

But she hadn't even had the chance. He was interrupted by comms signal. Activating his iris as he stopped, he asked, "What's up?"

"This Matthew?" someone from the other side said that for fun, immediately continued without clarification, "Listen. We could do with a little help over here." Oren and the others overheard and turned back, gathered around him to hear the news. "Bit of a snafu."

"Volffs, eh?"{{footnote: Wait, you could see?}}

"More of 'em than we expected."

"No rest for the wicked. Copy that. I'll head over. You want me at Daedal Isle, right?"

"That's it. Thanks."

"Dillon, eh?" asked Oren. He recognized the voice. 

"Yeah. Says they're having trouble with Volffs. Gonna lend 'em a hand."

"Damn. They've really been multiplying. "

"Sure looks like it." Then, he apologized, "My bad, Na'el. I'll catch you up later."

Her eyes widened, subconsciously replied, "Uh, 'Kay." But there's no more latter. Not that one could summon such courage a second time if the time's no longer right. And she saw him running off himself, leaving behind her and the other City soldiers. 

---

Back at the City, people were walking along the metallic road; man, women, elderly, children. Some gathered around and have fun in front of someone's door; or perhaps it was some place else, cause one saw ladder attached to the wall. The wall lights, one of them, shone right at the window from above. Through the window, we saw Na'el sitting by herself in the dark, in her room, beside the fireplace. Difference is, she was now holding the crystal in her hands. She recalled what the sound spoke, 

> "_Let us away... Towards a new world... Out with the old. And in once more, with the new._"

She was so engaged with the crystal she missed the sounds of objects drifting through the air. As the speech finished, she hadn't had time to think when it struck right in the middle of the City, exploded, and the flames lit up the room. "**Ah!**" She stood up, wondered what'd happened. "**Ngh!**" Ran out, and heard the emergency siren that signifies City under siege. Flames burning. Levnises roamed the streets. Folks running. "**Oh, hu huh hrgggghhh!**" Now where she'd lived the past 15 years will be wiped out except from distorted memories. Temporarily, she froze, unable to do anything, unable to know what to do, the crystal still holding in her hands. 

---

Z, in the cinema room, started speaking, "It has been over a decade since Alpha seized Origin. This eve he intends to show himself at last... **While Origin remains** in Alpha's _clutches_, my will cannot extend beyond its _threshold_... I trust you will **set forth** once more."

A bright light shone on N. He said nothing, gave a long pause, before teleported away, disappeared, bringing away the beam of spotlight with him. 

"_Sword of the End..._ That which denies _fate, and makes its essence mercurial... What machinations could have led it into that man's grasp...?_" After a pause, "Hmph. I see Origin **brims** with the very will... **of those** who are as _unto_ **gods**..." And the Moebius sign in his Iris shone bright red. Then the light went off. 

---

"Na'el?! You're... I thought you were dead! *I'm so glad... I... I was so sure you'd... I thought I'd really lost you for good this time...*" No, when you're hijacked by emotions, no observations were made. Only when he took a look at her current status did he noticed, "**Uhuhuh! What's up with that outfit, huh?** Where'd you pick up a weird... getup like-" He started walking towards her.

Immediately, Rex shouted, "**Matthew, no! It's not her!**"

"Huh? Not- Na'el? But it clearly is! How can you not recognize her? **OH, of course! You've never met her before!** Hang on, I-I should have a photo..." Nonetheless, his steps were stopped after attention diverted. He reached for his pocket. 

"**Matthew! Look at me!**" A sternly called for his attention. He stopped reaching for the photo. "The person you see before you isn't Na'el. It is in part, but not wholly. Inside of her... **is Alpha!**" Na'el had a thin smile on her face all the time they were interacting, spoke no word. 

"**HUH?**" He cannot believed what she just spoke, teasingly hoped she's joking, "Not you too, A? **What** is this? Who is this- 'Alpha' guy anyway? _I don't understand...!_"

Na'el urged, "What are you doing? Come quickly. Everyone's waiting, Matthew." There should be no more convincing happening on their side. 

Matthew as Matthew, his curiosity had to be satisfied, all things had to be cleared, before he pursue. Despite his strong urge to reunite, he begged, "Na'el, hold up a minute, yeah? Seems there's something really... confusing going on here..."

Shulk began to tell a story, "Alpha... suddenly appeared one day. With the goal of destroying this world." That was when the three of them were facing him in the bright luminescent space. "Rex and I, and Z too... We fought against Alpha. To save the world from his rancor. Alpha's power is unparalleled. _For all our efforts, it wasn't enough._ Even our collective might failed to repel him. In the end... All we managed was to buy a fraction more time." And the price paid? His right hand; _his_ left eye. 

A continued, "Having tasted frustration in battle, Alpha understood." She looked at the core crystal embedded to the suit, exactly like the one dangling on one of her ears, continued, "He realized... he needed something to amplify his power. An avatar."

"_Huh..._" And he turned his attention back to the glowing Na'el. 

"Na'el is the avatar, Matthew."

"_Orgh..._"

"The day the City fell... You didn't... _lose_ Na'el because she went missing. Rather... she had become Alpha's vessel." Na'el's eyes fixated on Matthew, waiting for his reply, ignoring the others. 

Matthew denied their explanations, "No... Come on, A, not you too, I can't...! **What the hell is this?! Can you stop making shit up?**"

Rex shouted back, "**There'll be time for explaining later! For now, you gotta give her a real drubbing!**" Rex, Shulk, and A prepared their weapons. 

"**Huh? 'Drub-bing'?!**" How dare you do this to Na'el, without explanation? She is my sister, **my sister!** And you want to hit her in front of her brother? 

Shulk explained, "Not that violent. If at all possible, we will free Na'el."

"**And if it's not?!**"

Rex be the red face guy, "**If it's not, then... Better buckle up, kid!**"

"**YOU CAN'T BE BLOODY SERIOUS!!!**"

Na'el concluded, "Hrmph. You are in the way... of our vision."

"Na'el...?" What are you talking about? _Our_ vision? What vision? 

"Say... What's so great about this world, really? All the thieving for one's own **gain! The greed! Life, has less value in this world than a PIECE of DIRT! THIS IS YOUR WORLD OF PEACE?!**"

"Urmph..." "Ngh..." The bang it sent into the hearts of Nikol and Glimmer; who were more felt{{footnote: 感同身受}} than them soldiers living such life for the past 9 terms! 

"_We don't need it... **Do we**, Matthew?_ **ANSWER!**"

"_Urgh!!!_" He don't know how to answer. Their difference in perspective now grew to such length that he no longer understand his sister. Therefore, he froze. 

"_Huh..._" She shook her head, "You disappoint me, truly." Should have known better. He always he. "I didn't think you'd side with _them_."

"**I- HAVEN'T! I'M JUST...!**"

"Enough of this. We will simply go alone, then." And she drew her blades. All those that hadn't drew their blades now drew it out, except Matthew. 

"**NA'EL!!!**" 

With sharp cuts, her stiff tone concluded, "**Goodbye**... my brother."

---

More and more energy unleashed as shockwaves directed at the group. Imagine trying to walk in a strong wind without cover, your body heavily tilted  forward. 

"**Bastard...!**" Rex couldn't believe it, "That's a helluva lot more power than before!"

A explained, "**It's the avatar. Her emotions are heightened. They're feeding straight into Alpha's power.**"

"**URGHHHH!!! Na-Na'el...! Hey... stop this!**" She directed more focus on him as he tried to cut off,  "**PLEASE, JUST STOOOOOPPPPP!!!**" 

Suddenly, a purple beam descend the clouds from behind Matthew, ignored the shockwave effect, and sliced at Na'el. Such slice halt the expending energy waves. Dust and dirt splattered where Na'el stood. 

"Huh?" The others were wondering what happened. 

"Hrhhh..." Such annoying power, despite herself unhurt. The sound of teleportation appeared; Matthew turned to see who he is. "No... Not him?!" The haunting nightmarish guy, with dull eyes despair of all hopes, appeared. The memories of sword pierced into his grandad's stomach still lingers clear and bright. 

"N!" A called out. 

"If raw emotion _is what affords him strength,_ it must be disrupted with emotion stronger still. You fail to reach such a _zenith. Alpha..._" Step by step, he took straight towards her, ignoring the others would-be allies, intending to take her down himself. "_I, N, shall thwart you once more. My blade will cut..._" and he put his hand on the grip, gathering the power of purple lights, "**your very will!**" And sliced so fast he's already in front of her before he finished his words. Alpha reacted just as quickly, blocked it with her blades. And they now fight one on one. 

Rex was surprised, "**Sword of the End?!** He's gonna use it?!"

"Sure about that?" Alpha asked. "I am _Na'el_, you know."

"I am divorced of all that." The ringing reverberates the air particles, creating a high-pitch ringing like the ones in tinnitus, or the ones to repel mosquitoes, "All doubts... misgivings... **Gone!**" One that had lost all hopes cannot be hoped for. Round 2. 

---

His hands on the hilt; Matthew gritted his teeth as he shielded Na'el. He pulled anyways, brought both of them down. Matthew dragged to one direction, Na'el rolled on another. He looked at them without emotion, gently put his sword back into the scabbard. 

"Urgh urggghhh... Na'... el..." He saw where she was, but his strength were gone too far to reach her. 

With effetely crying tone, she pleaded, "_Help me..._"

This is his sister, this is his sister; and now she's crying for help. She never asked for; now that she asked, he had to! 

"_Matthew..._"

N watched the performance with dull eyes. Tired of such performance, "This again, Alpha? Really...?"

"**Na'el!**" He pushed and pushed and pushed, dragged his uncontrolling body along the dirt, pushing with all the strength in his arms. Even if he cannot stand, he had to reach for her. 

The ringing started again as N was bound to end it all. The Sword of the End reverberated the air, penetrated even into the fabric that made up the world. "_It is over..._" He therefore slashed it. 

At very last, "**No!**" The will to protect is the will of the Ouroboros. "**STOOOOPPPP!!!**" He then regained his strength as the power of the Ouroboros came alive within him. Such energy capable even to stop N's attacks. 

"Hurggghhh..." He dragged back as the force pushed him with. The soul of the Ouroboros leave a Dharma image{{footnote: 法相虚影。}} on the surface of his body. He now remembered, "It's you..."

Behind him, Alpha had a thin smile on her face. It had succeeded. He'd succeeded in evoking his emotions to their Grandad. 

"**Like killing Grandad wasn't enough for you... NOW NA'EL, TOO?!!**" His Ouroboros power grew stronger and stronger with emotions. He then punched and make a great ball of energy flying towards N. He hadn't even blocked when A did so. "Huh? **THE HELL YOU PLAYING AT, A? WHY?!!!**"

"You must not lash out at him, Matthew! **He's not your enemy, I promise you!**"

Between the smokescreen, their voice were muted; but that didn't stop them from hearing (but not listening) to each other. "**STOP TALKING SHITE!!! HE'S TRYING TO KILL NA'EL!!! HE KILLED GRANDAD!!! AND YOU'RE...!**"

She stopped him, "He is... **your flesh and blood!**"

"Wha-?!"

A turned to look at him. OK, since he wanted to know, he reached for the button that remove his golden mask. The Moebius symbol first came online in his iris, but what shocked him the most, is his facial image, so similar to the ones he saw on the photo. The photo where he, _he_, sat beside the hospital bed, along with the woman whom was Grandad's mum! "**HUHHH!!!** Impossible... **Can't be...!**"

Alpha, still lying on the floor behind him, found an emotional weakness for him to manipulate, "Yet... It was this man who tried to erase me. **He- is** the one to blame!"

"Na'el..." He watched as she stood on her feet. Alpha looked into N's eyes, and he looked back. 

Looking into his eyes, she noted, "They're strong, your emotions. Stronger _even_... than my own.{{footnote: Such emotions you had to watch Xenoblade 3 to understand.}} _Ungh._" The rest of the group now became sidekicks. 

Rex looked at Alpha's core, wonder why he would talked at such length, observed something that the people who're too indulged in their speech hadn't saw. His core was damaged; there was a slice on it, and particles escaped. Even Alpha's core can't bear the power of the Sword of the End, eh! She used her right hand to cover it thereafter. "Think you've bought yourself some time?"

N answered, "We may not have much, but it's more than we need to **erase** you."

"Quite. Well then, I'm happy to wait." Then, she turned to Matthew, "For you both, yes?" In a beam of light, leaving behind some particles, she teleported away, not waiting for their answer. She had to go and heal before her wounds reached unbearable length, before she became too weak to risk taken hostage, to risk being erased. 

Matthew just felt sad. What happened? Reunions shouldn't be like this. Reunions should be such despairing. The stars still hung high in the sky; it had not been long, the battle, for the sun to rise. The rest of the day will be fill with explanations; for he want answers to what had been shielded from him throughout. Where's the trust? But before that, let's turn to a horn-like structure beyond the cliff-rocks that lurked visibly, reflected the light from the stars. 

---

On this structure{{footnote: If you'd watched Xenoblade 1, you'd know it's called 'prison island', the island that imprisoned Zanza.}}, the crystals on a semicircle arc on the only platform shone brightly. Then, electric balls started gathering on a larger arc in mid-air that reflected it. All chains of electricity independently shot high up into the air, creating a few beams of continuous lightning that brightly lit the sky. 

At the very top of where the electricity delivered, a spiral started forming, reverberating energy to its surroundings. After the energy dimmed down, a circular disc feature, where each layer of its teeth turned anti to each other{{footnote: Meaning, if layer 1 turned clockwise, layer 2 will be anticlockwise, and layer 3 clockwise, and each layer are seen as a 'ring' around the arc you can view as.}} cancelled its invisible status and appeared in mid-air. Such airship was so huge that if it smashed down, the whole vicinity would be wiped out; Matthew and the others would be erased from history. 

They watched as it slowly by slowly got closer and closer to land. But no, it stopped once it reached some height. Shulk was surprised, "**Origin?!! What's it doing here?!**"

Linka linked, "**It must be Alpha's doing!**"

Rex: "All it means, is that we don't have a whole lot of time to spare..."

Matthew was still lingering in his emotions; he still cannot forgive his great grandfather killing his grandpa. He clenched his teeth as N turned his attention back at him, watching him emotionlessly. A now came by his side, watching their interactions. He took a few steps forward, got closer to N, opened his mouth, "What..."

He already knew what he wanted to know, answered, even before he could spurt out the whole question, "Eternity..." Matthew bit his tongue. 

"**Sorry?**"

"My due. In return for protecting this world... Z promised me eternity..." And he showed his Moebius symbol. "**An eternal present in which to abide.**"

> Z watched him with both eyes Moebius,turned him from the state in his picture to his current state (more older looking), and put him on a Y-shaped road, where he stood at the bottom of the Y, and faced 2 path beyond him to choose. 

"Z? Is that the Moebius head honcho? **What d'you even do with eternity?For starters, you Moebius're-** _huh!_" Then he bit his tongue as he got reminded of something. In the picture, it wasn't just him; but him, the woman with silver hair and cat ears, and the baby. Particularly, the woman. "_Bastard...!_" He already understood. "**That's the reason for this?**" 

N knew he understood, closed his eyes and turned around. He then looked up at the sky, at Origin, changed the subject. She is not what he would want to talk about to them. "I'm sure... you plan to _pursue_ them... And yet, I will not let you reach them. Before you can interpose yourself..." He peered over his shoulder at Matthew. "I will cut Alpha down. You'd do well to remember that."

"You serious? Even Na'el? **She's your flesh and blood too!**" Shouldn't he had understood the moment he killed his son for eternity with her? Doesn't matter. He don't need him to understand. He therefore teleported away without leaving him an answer. But wasn't that the clearest answer given? 

---

The night changed day, and Origin can now be seen clearly floating up in the sky. Looking up at their camp, Matthew know he had no long time. Before he reach her, or before it crash down, he had to be there first. "_Ungh...._"

While the others were conversing at the camp, Shulk, Rex, and A approached him, with Shulk leading, "Matthew. Come on, let's go back to base and regroup. We'll tell you everything we know."

"Damn straight..." Can you feel being betrayed, being held back from speaking until the dam collapsed? White lie is a lie, no matter how 'white' it is. It does not feel better, not is it better, than a 'black' lie. "I'm done being kept in the dark. 'Bout time you let me into the club." His strong, unforgiving eyes looking at A. Why did she even knew these guys beforehand? And she never told him before? 

A:  "Huh..." Shulk nodded. A turned back first to the campfire, followed by the rest.
