# Postscript

Even if the story is short, there are some stories which we could learn. For example, how Glimmer and Nikol whom used to be enemies became friends. Nikol is more relieved and easier to accept the enemy than Glimmer. What makes them relatively easier than in real life to put down is, first, the author wanted them to. Second, they had no conflict other than that of physical. If they'd difference in beliefs, they wouldn't have so easily tolerated each other. Plus, Matthew gave them a common enemy to unite them: Moebius. (No, not Alpha, that's acquired later, and not that Matthew agrees Alpha is the enemy from early on, at least not before he knew whom Alpha was). Refer to _The Power of Strangers_ by Joe Keohane. 

From Matthew's standpoint, it's quite hearthurt to have the old guys retained info from him. Sure, they don't want him to lose his hope that Na'el had been taken hostage willingly; but, apart from their underestimation of his optimism, white lie is not less worse than black lie: they're both a lie. And retaining info is a white lie. 

Throughout the whole story, the goal is only one -- get Na'el back to Matthew's side. No, the search for City people are just a stepping stone to finding Na'el. He cares but not as much as Na'el. Upon finding Na'el, she does not want to go back to him; and his goal is to convince her to go back with him. He started with denial -- and A broke his dreams. Now that part is interesting, because _we_ start with denial too. We deny because **when people change, we don't change our _them_**. _They_ who lives in our brain is still their old selves, the one that hadn't changed. Supposingly, we should've updated our models of them, albeit not perfectly, at least what they'd displayed; but no, we held on to our old models, believing they don't change. That's why, if you had childhood friends whom you don't meet often, or whom you don't met for a long time, when you visit each other, don't think of each other as still the same as before. Time took its carvings on their personality and behaviors. 

While Rex said Logos is male, Pneuma is female, then Ontos is both; one had another look. Being a computer processor, just like that installed on your desktop/laptop, it is sexless. You can want it to be male, or you can want it to be female. What, it's just one click away on changing the voice of your AI from one sex to another, no?  

See you in the next book!
