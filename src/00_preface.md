# Preface

One wrote this after Xenoblade Chronicles 3 The Book. For such, we employed what one had adapted in the former book to this book. One called oneself the "Translator", since one translates from video to words, rather than writer nor author not other labels. 

The book itself is short, without much to say about. Though, speaking of a tragedy thousands of years ago from the main story, we know more about what missing information there is. Still, one had some difficulty, when writing the book, in terms of emotions. That we'll try to fix in the next book; but for now, have a good read!

### Ways to Read

If you see- words- in- dash-, it means there are a short pause in between words. If you see... dots..., it means a long pause in between speech. If you see **bold characters**, it means shouting out. **BOLD AND CAPITALS** means shouting to the largest amplitude your throat can take you. _Italics_ means soft, unless otherwise specified, which means dreams/recalling from the memory. 

> Things in quotes like this are either long memories that can't be compressed in a single _italics_, or if otherwise stated, some note one added. 

The others should be clear per se.
