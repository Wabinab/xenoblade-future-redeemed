<p>The group trod the road, hamburgered by two levnises, one in the front, one at the back.{{footnote: It's a wonder how they climb rocks, but one assumed they can jump or even glide/fly short distance, given the jet-engine like object attached to their back which one guessed is jet engines.}} The ground was green; and there seemed to be a turn in front.{{footnote: Though, in the evening sky, you can't see well.}} To the left where they currently walked were tall cliffs, and to the right, a cliff to fall off the ledge; but soon they'll enter a region where both side are cliffs. Matthew was walking behind Dillon, looking at his figure, but his thoughts drifted afar.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back at the City, nice blue day with some clouds. Perhaps it was memories, the scene wasn't so bright and clear. Matthew and Dillon spoke with each other, Na'el accompanied the former, and Grandpa watching over them, just outside the City. Other folks were forming their own little circles here and there, conversing. Children may participate, shouting or speaking, but they may adrift, not too interested in adult conversations, like the girl whom always tried to find Na'el to play her piano.</p>
<p>Too bored of their parents talk, she searched her surrounding until she found her. Immediately she shouted, "<strong>Na'el!</strong>" as her face brightened from dull, and she already ran off towards her. Na'el heard her shouts, turned towards her. Her parents might have wanted to put brakes on her but was too slow to react. Na'el knelt down and she jumped into her hugs. Matthew turned and saw the scenery.</p>
<p>"Mm, you smell nice. Guess I won't see you for a while..."</p>
<p>"Come and visit!"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I will I promise."</p>
<p>"I wanna hear you play again!"</p>
<p>"Without a piano? Tricky..."</p>
<p>"Then bring one with you!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Uhh...</strong>" As if that can be easily brought; not like it's an electrical ones, but with chord and strings. Actually, the other groups stopped talking and just looked at the interaction, weirdly. One of them represented the others and walked towards Matthew and the others, said,</p>
<p>"We'll all miss you guys. It's been a long time coming. Place is full up."</p>
<p>Matthew took over the conversation, "Don't forget to call us, soon as you arrive."</p>
<p>"Yeah. A second City... We'll make it greater than you can ever imagine."</p>
<p>"Them's fighting words."</p>
<p>"Huh, hahaha!" There was silence between them, but their eyes transferred more emotions than can be put into language. After a while, Matthew held out his fist, and he punched back.</p>
<p>Later on, Na'el, Matthew, Dillon, and some others that chose to left behind watched as they left. The child, being the last, turned around and shouted, "<strong>Na'el! Remember your promise!</strong>" She waved as she did so. Her parents waited for her while others walked on.</p>
<p>Na'el, with some thin sadness in her, waved back. Matthew watched her; she dropped her hands. The girl slumped forward, and walked off talking to her parents, not knowing where the future lies.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Ungh..."</p>
<p>"Hmph..." A, walking to his 10 o'clock, sensed something deep in him, perhaps she always sensed so.</p>
<hr />
<p>The guys walked over a bridge paved with lush green. The town had a waterfall near it, and its buildings were overgrown. Two soldiers took watch at the bridge. The levnises accompanying them were nowhere to be seen{{footnote: Actually, the left themselves guarding the beginning side of the bridge.}}; only the people entered the town. Stopped and scanned, Matthew may have been a little disappointed, neutrally commented, "This it...?"</p>
<p>Shulk and the others turned around, himself acknowledged, "Yes. The Liberators' base of operations. All the City survivors we find, we keep safe here."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> People and Nopons sitting around chairs laid on a table, talking to each other. Seemingly this is a canteen. There are tents around where it laid. Bazaars opened their service for anyone wanting to buy goods. Levnises parked themselves at their respective parking lots. There was a tall tower-like structure, climbed by vines, joined on 4 sides by bridges of various climbing angle, to a platform below the tall structure. The platform was guarded by levnises. Further away was some structures that may be part of the tower structure, or may be independent ones. There was a pond below it, probably water from the waterfall earlier. We could see the Great Sword{{footnote: One assumed you already know the Great Sword from Xenoblade 3 and/or Xenoblade 1.}} that pierced into the land from afar. This, is <strong>Colony 9</strong>, in Yesterdale.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>"Well then, once again, welcome. To our headquarters... To Colony 9."</p>
<p>"Uh? Colony 9? Like the one from Keves?" Glimmer was surprised by its name.</p>
<p>Panacea rebutted, "No, <em>not that one</em>. This is the <strong>original</strong> Colony 9. Though I guess that won't mean anything to you, one way or another."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Nikol was more confused than ever.</p>
<p>"I-I don't get it." announced Glimmer.</p>
<p>"Well, anyway! Point is, it's <strong>not- like</strong> a Kevesi or Agnian colony. That's all you need to know right now."</p>
<p>"Uhhh... OK..." Nikol felt.</p>
<p>Linka announced, "I'll go on ahead to the command center and have your quarters prepared. If you'll excuse me..." And she immediately leave.</p>
<p>Dillon also was about to leave, "Right, see you around then, Matthew. Let's have a proper catch-up once things have settled down a bit."</p>
<p>"<strong>Will do, cheers!</strong>" And he did the Chinese welcoming/farewell stance.</p>
<p>Rex looked to Shulk, said, "Righto, let's see how the gang's doing. We can give you a little tour along the way."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's a good idea!" agreed Shulk. "Panacea, can I ask you to take point?"</p>
<p>She agreed, then shouted to the newcomers, "<strong>Right, you heard the man. Try to keep up!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Walking immediately past the tall buildings on both side of the main road, we saw the bazaar and the canteen at the 'square', which is really a roundabout with other structures surrounding the roundabout. Panacea introduced, "The plaza's kind of the heart of Colony 9. Anything you're looking for, you can more or less find it here, be it extra supplies or a quick bite to eat."</p>
<p>Matthew was excited, "<strong>Wow, it's pretty bustlin'.</strong> Reminds me of the City."</p>
<p>Shulk asked, "Well then, would you like to take a little look around?"</p>
<p>"Is- that OK?" questioned Nikol.</p>
<p>Rex replied, "We're not in a hurry or anything. You go and have your stroll."</p>
<p>Panacea: "I'll be waiting for you over there, past the plaza. Speak to me when you're done browsing." That's the other exit of the roundabout -- it only have 2 exits.</p>
<p>"Aight then, don't mind if we do. Let's go have a shufti, guys."</p>
<hr />
<p>Later, they met Panacea, whom asked, "You all done then?"</p>
<p>"Sure. Sorry you had to wait."</p>
<p>"OK. Then let's move swiftly on. Follow me."</p>
<hr />
<p>As they continued walking, Matthew commented, "The City folks I saw actually look pretty happy to be here, huh. It's good to see."</p>
<p>"They're our fellow Liberators now, after all. It's only natural we'd support one another." added Shulk.</p>
<p>"Ah, well... Thanks for that. I mean it, thank you."</p>
<p>"<strong>Eh,</strong> having more helping hands is pretty welcome from our side too." Rex complimented.</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm seeing these tents all over the place. You've got some proper buildings here. Wouldn't it make more sense to live <strong>inside</strong> those?"</p>
<p>Panacea explained, "You'd think, but they're falling apart inside. We've got a policy to avoid living somewhere that might cave in on you." Surely, the trees and punched their roots through the concrete walls; they don't look really safe to one.</p>
<p>"Hmm... Still, feels like a waste."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ohhh!</strong> That contraption!" exclaimed Nikol.</p>
<p>"It's a gem crafting furnace. Pretty antique one." Panacea explained. It was 1.5x the height of an average human, shaped like a thermometer where you can insert the gems at the bottom 'fat' part, and tweak the knobs to the side on the stem as it boils up, and the output will be one don't know where.</p>
<p>Rex: "It's been out of commission for <strong>a-ges</strong>. At this point it's pretty much just scrap."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see..." Nikol commented.</p>
<p>"<strong>Right</strong>, this is where I leave you." said Panacea. They'd arrived at the Command Center. Tables were laid, looking like receptions. Behind the command center was an opening with some balcony overlooking the waterfall. Tables and other objects were laid around, people talking to each other. "This is the command center. It's... where the cap-tains convene, where we plan our strategies and manage affairs. The <strong>nerve</strong> center of the Liberators, you could say."</p>
<p>"Well met, everyone." Linka rejoined the group. "I'm happy to inform you that quarters have been arranged for Matthew and his associates."</p>
<p>Rex: "Great, cheers for that!"</p>
<p>"Allow me to show you the way."</p>
<p>Matthew: "Thanks, that'd be great." They walked out of the command center and head towards the direction of the tower-like structure. By the beginning of the bridge, to its side was a place where soil were tilled and planted. Kevesi and Agnians were working there.</p>
<p>"What? Never seen a field?" asked Panacea.</p>
<p>"No." Matthew continued, "Those guys... They're Kevesi and Agnian soldiers, aren't they?"</p>
<p>"They were. Teacher, and the others freed them." And Matthew was taken aback in memories.</p>
<hr />
<p>Where a rainbow casted over a waterfall, and a machine hidden below the rocks, Na'el and Matthew lead some City folks towards the pond. There was a monster imitating as a giant flower, hiding its body underwater; such flower was attached to its back.</p>
<p>They walked behind the waterfall, and Matthew noticed something, "<em>Whoa...</em>" Boxes of resources were laid there; but what interested were the bundle of corpse laid randomly on the floor, all dead. Creatures with a torch attached to their tail crawl around, perhaps to eat their remains, perhaps they just roam. Skittles (flying bugs) occupy some of the air field. "<em>What in the...?</em> Doesn't look like they died in combat... All the husks around here are whip-thin." The corpses looked Kevesi from their signature armor.</p>
<p>"You think they starved...?" asked one of the female City folk wearing goggles.</p>
<p>"<em>Maybe.</em>"</p>
<p>"With this much wildlife around, though?"</p>
<p>"Most things around these parts are poisonous. Not really edible."</p>
<p>"Well... there's Castle supplies. Don't they get those?" asked another low-tone male City folk.</p>
<p>"You think they got raided, maybe?" hypothesized Na'el.</p>
<p>"Doubt it. Enemies woulda mopped 'em up. No sign of Blade wounds."</p>
<p>"Hmmm..."</p>
<p>"For whatever reason, intentional or not... These people... were abandoned."</p>
<p>"Local fauna aside... with this much fresh water, they could have easily farmed. There's so many ways they could've kept themselves alive...!"</p>
<p>The male City folk reminded her, "<em>Thing is, though, fighting's all these guys know.</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but..."</p>
<p>"You know they're not like us. Nobody taught them what could be..."</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<hr />
<p>As memories dimmed and faded, attention returned to the present. Linka explained, "It's not as simple as: plant some seeds, wait for the harvest. We're teaching them the ins and outs, as you can see. We're showing them there's more to life than battle."</p>
<p>"<em>You didn't do this in the City?</em>" asked Panacea.</p>
<p>"No... We did do that stuff. We did, but..."</p>
<p>"Hm?" Panacea and Linka were curious for so short a time that immediately after, they turned and walked away with Rex and Shulk. And they followed on. Matthew took one last look at the tilling groups as the others passed through him, his minds in Na'el's desperate shouts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Then show me already! This world of peace, where nobody has to die... Make it come true!</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He shook off such thoughts and continued their tour. The turned around the corner instead of crossing the bridge towards the tower-like structure, into some alleyway that leads to tents with a campfire in the middle.</p>
<hr />
<p>"The tents we set up for you are further up along this road." said Panacea. "So thoughts, and questions?"</p>
<p>Matthew: "I'm liking the atmosphere. Just right for settling down."</p>
<p>Nikol: "There're... so many people, and it's so busy. It's worlds different from our colonies."</p>
<p>Glimmer: "For now, anyways, we'll be glad of your hospitality. Is that right?"</p>
<p>They arrived near the campfire, where Linka announced, "And these will be your tents. Feel free to use all the facilities here at your leisure."</p>
<p>Matthew: "We'll make the most of it. Thanks, for everything."</p>
<p>"It's all right. All in a day's work."</p>
<p>"All right then... It's a bit early to turn in still, so what say we have a little nose around?"</p>
<p>"Ah, that reminds me." said Shulk, whom was tailing them. "Riku said he had some business with you. Would you mind stopping by his place later?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Who's Riku, again?"</p>
<p>Nikol: "Oh, right... You've not met him yet, Matthew."</p>
<p>Shulk explained, "He's a Nopon mechanic working with us Liberators. Quite a skilled one, at that."</p>
<p>"Huh, if you say so. So, where's he at?"</p>
<p>"There's an abandoned house, near the entrance of the colony. A friend of mine used to live there. Riku's commandeered it lately. I hear he wants to establish his own workshop there."</p>
<p>"A <strong>workshop!!!</strong>" Nikol was getting excited about that.</p>
<p>"<strong>Ohhh</strong>, that tickled your fancy, did it, Nikol?" Matthew exclaimed.</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah, I-I really wanna check out his setup! Can we go now?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ahahah, sure thing, kid. Let's go and say hi before we bunk down."</p>
