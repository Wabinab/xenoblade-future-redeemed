<p>Amidst the blazing blizzard{{footnote: Meaning, intense flames that flamed the blizzard.}} stood 3 figures against a flying figure, whom expel an energy so intense it flamed the environment, emitting flame speckles and black fog. It wielded the Monado{{footnote: The sword of the God. It has a red case with a beaming blade within it.}}, and had some spell drawings behind him{{footnote: Signifying that he's a God.}}. Of the 3 figures, one is floating mid-air, with long hair that reached his pelvis and two thorns on his head{{footnote: If you read Xenoblade 3, it's Z.}}; another was a short hair guy wielding another Monado, and the last buff guy wielded two-handed swords.</p>
<p>"<strong>WHY?!!! TELL ME WHY!!!</strong>" He put a step forward, really angry at the flying figure. "<strong>IS THIS... REALLY WHAT YOU WANT?!!! ALVIS!!!</strong>" The guy wielding the Monado on the floor shouted to the God-like figure. He had sharp chin, cyan eyes, and quite long hair that cuts through his forehead and his nose, and both side of his chin. He wore a red-laced garment, short sleeved.</p>
<p>"<strong>Drop it, Shulk!</strong>" The guy wielding the dual blade shouted at him. He also had sharp chin, light brown iris, and hair that stood up with applied gel, wearing some leather armor, with buff muscles. "Nothing's gonna get through to him! <strong>He's a heartless MACHINE!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>WE HAVE TO TRY!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Fascinating!" The last of the floating figure exclaimed. "Is this how badly you wish to erase us... my god?!" He had purple lightning-like scars on his chin. His thorn is flaming, like emitting smokes. His ears was pointed, like that of an elf.</p>
<p>Alvis spoke nothing, emitting more energy, energy so strong it pushes the three back as they tried to defend themselves. "<strong>ARRRRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Against the morning sky, clouds shrouded the land. Only a few tall land pillars pierced into the clouds, showing figures that represent various form of beasts. To start our story, we'll take you through one of the 'island' that had an arch over it. It's relatively small compared to the other beasts, but even so, 'small' is relative.</p>
<p>As we zoomed into and passed the arc, immediately below it is a metal bridge so tall that connects to another region. Below the bridge laid some floating lily-leaves-like island that had its stems sticking high above the lake below it, connected to each other by rope bridges. Further down the edge of the lake were lush green plains that was home to many animals. Not to forget the ruins that were swallowed by the rocks.</p>
<p>As we followed the canyon to the other side, more trees emerged, including one giant one that stood out with bright red leaves. Further down another crevasse after the open plains was battle-scarred grounds. Through one of the covered entrance hole, we were taken to a change in environment -- where tree leaves and grasses had autumn-like color. Some weird trees have blob-like turquoise{{footnote: Like dendrites and neurons.}} structure, and they were the only one that aren't autumn-colored. Even the reindeer had a darker red lines against black skin that let it camouflage in the environment.</p>
<p>Explosion, explosion, explosion. A single spider-like monster with purple energy flowing down its veins was running after a guy dressed in leather black and some red. He huffed and puffed as he peered over his shoulder to check for incoming attacks. "Huh huh huh <strong>Arrrgggh...</strong>" Sensing it, he jumped in time to dodge an incoming blast, and the girl behind him jumped and dodged another blast. Though, unlike him, she was cool, don't even pant.</p>
<p>"<strong>Errggghhhh</strong>" He ran a cycle and dashed towards the monster, jumped up and activated the gloves he's wearing, which lights up and transformed, and one punch on the figure, Newton's third law took him back where he was without even leaving a dent. Sharp chin,  slightly-tanned skin, bright turquoise iris, slightly sharp ears, and tied his hair behind him, attaching two ear-'rings' on his left, and a scar that crafted over one of his eyebrow. "Tough little so-and-so! Can't even seem to <strong>Break</strong> it!"</p>
<p>"I told you we should've left alone." He peered over his shoulder where she close in on him, "But you had to stick your oar in, didn't you?" She had dark turquoise big iris, lesser pointed chin, small nose, some ears, and her left ear had an earring that hung a Cross-like ruby jewel{{footnote: If you watched Xenoblade 2, you'd know that was similar to the one on Pyra/Mythra's chest.}}, wore some ocean-blue shirt, long slightly-gray lower garment, and wielded a red sword. "<strong>Matthew.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Hurgggg</strong>" The monster poached on them after she finished her word.</p>
<p>"Lecture me later, <strong>A</strong>! Aight? First things first!"</p>
<p>She exasperatedly snorted, "<em>Huh...</em> You're impossible..." Round 2.</p>
<hr />
<p>He dashed and jumped into the air; his fist glowed bright orange while his body illuminated dark turquoise, and his left iris glowed a dragon-biting-tail symboll{{footnote: Ouroboros}}, "<strong>HUAAAAAAAAA!!!</strong>" One punch on the floor and spiking dirt spit up in the direction of the spider; one large one shattered it, disengaged it, and evaporated it into black fog. "Huh... Third-rate <em>Moebius arsewipe</em>... Made us bloody work for it."</p>
<p>"What was that? That thing at the end?" A walked up to him, asked.</p>
<p>"<strong>What</strong> thing at the end...? You mean the Ouroboros power? Nice touch, eh? Heheh!"</p>
<p>"What I'm asking is <em>why you felt the need to use it at all.</em>" Turning to the empty dust, "The scrab was already falling apart."</p>
<p>"I mean, that was the last chance to, like, <strong>KA-POW</strong>, right? I had to make sure it's a good one." Folded his arm with pride, he convinced himself, "Leaves a bad taste otherwise, the whole rest of the day."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>" She sighed, "Moebius track it, you know. The... Ouroboros power. You need to keep a lid on it. Like I keep telling you."</p>
<p>"It was only a little whiff! All fine in the end. We won, <em>so what's the damage?</em>" And before she could speak, he blurted impatiently, "Less of the lectures!"</p>
<p>"The word you should've used is 'fewer'. Grammar matters."</p>
<p>"You... did it again..." And he took out a gadget shaped like a double arrow, with a spinning wheel on one end encased in an opening, with a cone on the other part of it that seems like it can push out holograms from it. And indeed, clicking on it, a screen was displayed that showed their location and other details with an empty map. "Huuuuhhh... Another day without any signals." And he just shook his head with disappointment. He turned it off and tucked it back into his pocket.</p>
<p>A walked in front of him, looking sideways, suggested, "Time to pack it in, then?"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em>"</p>
<p>She turned to look at him seriously, "After all our efforts, we've not met a single survivor from the City."</p>
<p>"<em>Hmmm...</em> You promise me back then. Remember?"</p>

<p>In their memory, they were standing by a spot with some grass. She stood by his side; he knelt down and put some flowers in front of a really tiny (short) gravestone.{{footnote: Well, at least a stone w/o encarvings that one can took it as a grave-<em>stone</em>.}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued, "That we'd find every last Citizen." She looked at him, said nothing. He continued shortly thereafter, "Well I'm not stopping." Looking up at the sky: "I won't quit. Not until I've done just that."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another memory, kids playing with each other in a circle. The surrounding was some buildings, grass, bushes, barrels. One of the kid jumped into the hug of a cat-eared female. She wore some bare-gloves{{footnote: One that only cover the palms but not the fingers.}}, a light-brown jacket, and pale skinned, golden iris. Matthew was standing beside her. Another scene, she was speaking to Matthew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His motivation shall not fade. Suggesting, "<strong>Let's move on.</strong> Tomorrow'll be our lucky day. <strong>I can feel it!</strong>" And he continued walking down the path to the exit of the dead end. A just looked at him crossing in front of her, could understood why he desired so much. She shall just walk beside him, into the unknown future, without trying to impose her desire on his.</p>

<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> The evening sun sets behind the monster-like mountains. The autumn leaves blanketed most of the undergrowth. Only the taller land were free from their invasion, a <em>Naturgemälde</em>. The giant head-like land could be seen afar. A shallow stream ran across the undergrowth, replenishing its content from those splashing down the tip of the rock. The grass, the rare shrubs, and the water supply hosted a habitat for various animals, including bunnits{{footnote: Some rabbit monsters.}} and krabble{{footnote: Some crab-in-shell monster}}. The dendrites-looking tree with crystal-like blue glob made their occasional appearances beside the ever-brown. This, is <strong>Vermillon Woods.</strong></p>

<p>{{footnote: Introducing the Cent-Omnia region. This part is not available in the first video, only the second.}} "Say... The Cent-Omnia region we're in now... It's smack in the middle of Aionios, yeah?"</p>
<p>A replied, "Yes. That assessment is correct."</p>
<p>"Right, so... if we captured this area, couldn't we raid the other regions pretty much at will?" A relatively barren hill was displayed, along with the Great Sword, a sword that pierced deep into the heart of Aionios, it's handle reaching higher than the clouds, lurking far, far away. "This is the only place connected to the other four regions at once, right?"</p>
<p>"Which means that conversely, it can also <em>be</em> attacked from all four sides." In another scene, seen from above treetops, a hand structure hovered over some civilization remains.</p>
<p>"Ah... Yyyyeah, there's that..."</p>
<p>"But I'll admit... that it does have the strategic value that you ascribed to it. It's an undeniable fact that both Keves and Agnus are <strong>desperate</strong> to gain control of this region... The positional advantage of having access to all other regions may make the attendant risks more palatable." Something that caught one's eye is a dim blue light in the sky-piercing 'natural' structure far away, in yet another scene; though one can't recognize what it is.{{footnote: If you'd ask one to guess, one'd say that's "Prison Island" from Xenoblade 1. Because there's a slope to the right of that structure, at least in 2D view, that one can ascribed to one of the structure one saw in Xenoblade 1.}}</p>
<p>"I see, I see..."</p>
<hr />
<p>They found a tiny waterfall, about 3 meters high, and a small pond below. Matthew noted, "All right. This'll be a good place for a rest."</p>
<p>A scanned the sky, observed stars, and noted, "Night, has caught up with us. We had better make haste setting up camp."</p>
<hr />
<p>One bed on each side of the campfire. A was far asleep, at least it seems so, while Matthew laid on his side, his elbow bent such that his head can rest on <em>that</em> hand's palm, watching the fire. But his mind was on something else.</p>

<p>"Huh huh huh huh huh huh <strong>NA'EL!!! GRANDAD!!!</strong>" He was running towards the central stage, where fire swallowed a few people, and burning rubble. He cared not of the stench; his attention was on something much more important.</p>
<p>"Huh..." Just in time to see a golden-mask golden-armor Moebius with an X in his chest{{footnote: One'll not introduce this guy first, even in this footnote, to avoid spoilers. He'll prove important.}} thrusting his katana straight at the chest of a gray-robe old man.</p>
<p>The old man, both his hands on the sword thrusted inside him, spoke effetely, "<em>Matthew...</em>"{{footnote: Italics meant <em>speaking softly/effetely.</em>}}</p>
<p>Matthew dashed towards him, "<strong>GRANDAD...!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Take care of Na'el... the future..." His speech became faster and faster while Ouroboros power was swallowing him. His soul was being pushed out of his husk as it glows brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>"<strong>GRANDAD!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>It's in your hands, Matthew!</strong>" A burst so strong pushed outwards that engulfed the three of them; and those figures in the flames, those many, and Na'el, the cat-eared girl from earlier, stood outside the flames, watching Grandad and Matthew. The flames suddenly released a great burst of energy that pushed into the air{{footnote: One guesses this is some kind of random teleportation device that'll send everyone in every single direction individually and randomly.}} while the Ouroboros flames swallowed everything in its vicinity, including the flame pillars.</p>
<p>"<strong>AAAAAARRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Urgh..." And he switched to the other side, feeling disquieted. While he wasn't looking, A raised her head and looked at him for a moment before going back to sleep. The sounds of insect and birds chirping are all there was. He had to take it himself; no one could help him out if he can't help himself.</p>
<p>On some other places, someone was running for their dear life, panting hard. "Heh heh heh heh heh heh...." Grass everywhere. There were 3 of them. In the darkness, we can't see who they are. Behind them were Kevesi soldiers and Levnises going after them, holding up torches. They knelt down, hid behind a rock, perhaps realize they'll die today.</p>
<p>But hey, something blasted at the Kevesi just after they sat down, and the screams of "AAARRRRGGGHHHHH" disrupted the silent night. After it went dead, one of them got up to check the situation. (S)He saw only burning rubble and light-lit flames. "Hooo... <strong>HURGGGHHH!!!</strong>" They don't even had time to relax; some fiery dogs, its paws lit with flames, had surrounded them.  A short-haired silver-hair female with cat ears, with some God-like wings on her shoulders, walked from behind the dogs, not fearing the flames that <em>does not</em> scorch her feet. She had a cross crystal on her chest like that hanging from A's earring. As she walked, the remnants of the corpses turned into dust wherever she stepped. Their fate had been sealed.</p>
<hr />
<p>A pile of burnt logs left in the morning. He sat up, cross-legged on his sleeping bag. She was at the pond, unsure if she was refilling water, looking at her reflection, or what.</p>
<p>"Urgggg ahhh..." As he stretched, A got up from a knelt position and walked towards him, complaining,</p>
<p>"The sun's already hanging high in the sky, Matthew."</p>
<p>He stood up, replying, "S'pose I should thank you then, for letting me sleep in."</p>
<p>"Sleeping on the ground... I've never seen <em>anyone</em> make it look quite so <em>comfortable. I worry...</em>"</p>
<p>He explained, eyes on the ground, "Grandad and I did a lot of... camping out, back when I was a kid, I mean. It don't bother me." And he got down to roll his sleeping bag while A looked away.</p>
<p>"Beep beep" Suddenly, something on the terminal alerted them. "Huh?" Matthew stood up to pull out his terminal. A got nearer to him to check what news. "Blink..." And there was an extra red dot on the map in their vicinity, aside the green dot signaling their current location.</p>
<p>"What's that signal?"</p>
<p>"Ping from a City Iris..." As he tucked it back into his pocket, he felt the strong urge after so many failed attempts, finally, he saw light, "<strong>C'MON, A!!!</strong>" And they dashed towards the indicated location.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just in time to see a City dweller's corpse evaporating into golden motes.{{footnote: When people here die, they evaporate into motes of different colors: golden, blue, red...}} "Ohhh..." He slowly walked over, knelt down on one feet, and reminisced the golden motes that floated up to the sky.</p>
<p>A also knelt down and examined the wounds before it disappeared, observed, "Judging by the wounds, it probably wasn't Moebius. Probably monsters, caught him unawares." The corpse had disappeared, only the shirt, gauntlet, and other wearables remain. Standing up, she apologized, "I'm sorry. This is my fault. If I woke you up, you might've made it."</p>
<p>He punched on the ground immediately, which surprised her,"<strong>HUH!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>It isn't your fault, A. <strong>I</strong> shouldn't've been dozing like a div. We could've helped you, friend... I'm sorry...</em>" And he closed his eyes and reminisced for a moment. A kept quiet and just stayed beside him, accompanied him while he reminisced.</p>
