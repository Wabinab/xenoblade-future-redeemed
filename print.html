<p>One wrote this after Xenoblade Chronicles 3 The Book. For such, we employed what one had adapted in the former book to this book. One called oneself the "Translator", since one translates from video to words, rather than writer nor author not other labels.</p>
<p>The book itself is short, without much to say about. Though, speaking of a tragedy thousands of years ago from the main story, we know more about what missing information there is. Still, one had some difficulty, when writing the book, in terms of emotions. That we'll try to fix in the next book; but for now, have a good read!</p>

<p>If you see- words- in- dash-, it means there are a short pause in between words. If you see... dots..., it means a long pause in between speech. If you see <strong>bold characters</strong>, it means shouting out. <strong>BOLD AND CAPITALS</strong> means shouting to the largest amplitude your throat can take you. <em>Italics</em> means soft, unless otherwise specified, which means dreams/recalling from the memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things in quotes like this are either long memories that can't be compressed in a single <em>italics</em>, or if otherwise stated, some note one added.</p>

<p>The others should be clear per se.</p>

<p>Amidst the blazing blizzard{{footnote: Meaning, intense flames that flamed the blizzard.}} stood 3 figures against a flying figure, whom expel an energy so intense it flamed the environment, emitting flame speckles and black fog. It wielded the Monado{{footnote: The sword of the God. It has a red case with a beaming blade within it.}}, and had some spell drawings behind him{{footnote: Signifying that he's a God.}}. Of the 3 figures, one is floating mid-air, with long hair that reached his pelvis and two thorns on his head{{footnote: If you read Xenoblade 3, it's Z.}}; another was a short hair guy wielding another Monado, and the last buff guy wielded two-handed swords.</p>
<p>"<strong>WHY?!!! TELL ME WHY!!!</strong>" He put a step forward, really angry at the flying figure. "<strong>IS THIS... REALLY WHAT YOU WANT?!!! ALVIS!!!</strong>" The guy wielding the Monado on the floor shouted to the God-like figure. He had sharp chin, cyan eyes, and quite long hair that cuts through his forehead and his nose, and both side of his chin. He wore a red-laced garment, short sleeved.</p>
<p>"<strong>Drop it, Shulk!</strong>" The guy wielding the dual blade shouted at him. He also had sharp chin, light brown iris, and hair that stood up with applied gel, wearing some leather armor, with buff muscles. "Nothing's gonna get through to him! <strong>He's a heartless MACHINE!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>WE HAVE TO TRY!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Fascinating!" The last of the floating figure exclaimed. "Is this how badly you wish to erase us... my god?!" He had purple lightning-like scars on his chin. His thorn is flaming, like emitting smokes. His ears was pointed, like that of an elf.</p>
<p>Alvis spoke nothing, emitting more energy, energy so strong it pushes the three back as they tried to defend themselves. "<strong>ARRRRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Against the morning sky, clouds shrouded the land. Only a few tall land pillars pierced into the clouds, showing figures that represent various form of beasts. To start our story, we'll take you through one of the 'island' that had an arch over it. It's relatively small compared to the other beasts, but even so, 'small' is relative.</p>
<p>As we zoomed into and passed the arc, immediately below it is a metal bridge so tall that connects to another region. Below the bridge laid some floating lily-leaves-like island that had its stems sticking high above the lake below it, connected to each other by rope bridges. Further down the edge of the lake were lush green plains that was home to many animals. Not to forget the ruins that were swallowed by the rocks.</p>
<p>As we followed the canyon to the other side, more trees emerged, including one giant one that stood out with bright red leaves. Further down another crevasse after the open plains was battle-scarred grounds. Through one of the covered entrance hole, we were taken to a change in environment -- where tree leaves and grasses had autumn-like color. Some weird trees have blob-like turquoise{{footnote: Like dendrites and neurons.}} structure, and they were the only one that aren't autumn-colored. Even the reindeer had a darker red lines against black skin that let it camouflage in the environment.</p>
<p>Explosion, explosion, explosion. A single spider-like monster with purple energy flowing down its veins was running after a guy dressed in leather black and some red. He huffed and puffed as he peered over his shoulder to check for incoming attacks. "Huh huh huh <strong>Arrrgggh...</strong>" Sensing it, he jumped in time to dodge an incoming blast, and the girl behind him jumped and dodged another blast. Though, unlike him, she was cool, don't even pant.</p>
<p>"<strong>Errggghhhh</strong>" He ran a cycle and dashed towards the monster, jumped up and activated the gloves he's wearing, which lights up and transformed, and one punch on the figure, Newton's third law took him back where he was without even leaving a dent. Sharp chin,  slightly-tanned skin, bright turquoise iris, slightly sharp ears, and tied his hair behind him, attaching two ear-'rings' on his left, and a scar that crafted over one of his eyebrow. "Tough little so-and-so! Can't even seem to <strong>Break</strong> it!"</p>
<p>"I told you we should've left alone." He peered over his shoulder where she close in on him, "But you had to stick your oar in, didn't you?" She had dark turquoise big iris, lesser pointed chin, small nose, some ears, and her left ear had an earring that hung a Cross-like ruby jewel{{footnote: If you watched Xenoblade 2, you'd know that was similar to the one on Pyra/Mythra's chest.}}, wore some ocean-blue shirt, long slightly-gray lower garment, and wielded a red sword. "<strong>Matthew.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Hurgggg</strong>" The monster poached on them after she finished her word.</p>
<p>"Lecture me later, <strong>A</strong>! Aight? First things first!"</p>
<p>She exasperatedly snorted, "<em>Huh...</em> You're impossible..." Round 2.</p>
<hr />
<p>He dashed and jumped into the air; his fist glowed bright orange while his body illuminated dark turquoise, and his left iris glowed a dragon-biting-tail symboll{{footnote: Ouroboros}}, "<strong>HUAAAAAAAAA!!!</strong>" One punch on the floor and spiking dirt spit up in the direction of the spider; one large one shattered it, disengaged it, and evaporated it into black fog. "Huh... Third-rate <em>Moebius arsewipe</em>... Made us bloody work for it."</p>
<p>"What was that? That thing at the end?" A walked up to him, asked.</p>
<p>"<strong>What</strong> thing at the end...? You mean the Ouroboros power? Nice touch, eh? Heheh!"</p>
<p>"What I'm asking is <em>why you felt the need to use it at all.</em>" Turning to the empty dust, "The scrab was already falling apart."</p>
<p>"I mean, that was the last chance to, like, <strong>KA-POW</strong>, right? I had to make sure it's a good one." Folded his arm with pride, he convinced himself, "Leaves a bad taste otherwise, the whole rest of the day."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>" She sighed, "Moebius track it, you know. The... Ouroboros power. You need to keep a lid on it. Like I keep telling you."</p>
<p>"It was only a little whiff! All fine in the end. We won, <em>so what's the damage?</em>" And before she could speak, he blurted impatiently, "Less of the lectures!"</p>
<p>"The word you should've used is 'fewer'. Grammar matters."</p>
<p>"You... did it again..." And he took out a gadget shaped like a double arrow, with a spinning wheel on one end encased in an opening, with a cone on the other part of it that seems like it can push out holograms from it. And indeed, clicking on it, a screen was displayed that showed their location and other details with an empty map. "Huuuuhhh... Another day without any signals." And he just shook his head with disappointment. He turned it off and tucked it back into his pocket.</p>
<p>A walked in front of him, looking sideways, suggested, "Time to pack it in, then?"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em>"</p>
<p>She turned to look at him seriously, "After all our efforts, we've not met a single survivor from the City."</p>
<p>"<em>Hmmm...</em> You promise me back then. Remember?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In their memory, they were standing by a spot with some grass. She stood by his side; he knelt down and put some flowers in front of a really tiny (short) gravestone.{{footnote: Well, at least a stone w/o encarvings that one can took it as a grave-<em>stone</em>.}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued, "That we'd find every last Citizen." She looked at him, said nothing. He continued shortly thereafter, "Well I'm not stopping." Looking up at the sky: "I won't quit. Not until I've done just that."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another memory, kids playing with each other in a circle. The surrounding was some buildings, grass, bushes, barrels. One of the kid jumped into the hug of a cat-eared female. She wore some bare-gloves{{footnote: One that only cover the palms but not the fingers.}}, a light-brown jacket, and pale skinned, golden iris. Matthew was standing beside her. Another scene, she was speaking to Matthew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His motivation shall not fade. Suggesting, "<strong>Let's move on.</strong> Tomorrow'll be our lucky day. <strong>I can feel it!</strong>" And he continued walking down the path to the exit of the dead end. A just looked at him crossing in front of her, could understood why he desired so much. She shall just walk beside him, into the unknown future, without trying to impose her desire on his.</p>

<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> The evening sun sets behind the monster-like mountains. The autumn leaves blanketed most of the undergrowth. Only the taller land were free from their invasion, a <em>Naturgemälde</em>. The giant head-like land could be seen afar. A shallow stream ran across the undergrowth, replenishing its content from those splashing down the tip of the rock. The grass, the rare shrubs, and the water supply hosted a habitat for various animals, including bunnits{{footnote: Some rabbit monsters.}} and krabble{{footnote: Some crab-in-shell monster}}. The dendrites-looking tree with crystal-like blue glob made their occasional appearances beside the ever-brown. This, is <strong>Vermillon Woods.</strong></p>

<p>{{footnote: Introducing the Cent-Omnia region. This part is not available in the first video, only the second.}} "Say... The Cent-Omnia region we're in now... It's smack in the middle of Aionios, yeah?"</p>
<p>A replied, "Yes. That assessment is correct."</p>
<p>"Right, so... if we captured this area, couldn't we raid the other regions pretty much at will?" A relatively barren hill was displayed, along with the Great Sword, a sword that pierced deep into the heart of Aionios, it's handle reaching higher than the clouds, lurking far, far away. "This is the only place connected to the other four regions at once, right?"</p>
<p>"Which means that conversely, it can also <em>be</em> attacked from all four sides." In another scene, seen from above treetops, a hand structure hovered over some civilization remains.</p>
<p>"Ah... Yyyyeah, there's that..."</p>
<p>"But I'll admit... that it does have the strategic value that you ascribed to it. It's an undeniable fact that both Keves and Agnus are <strong>desperate</strong> to gain control of this region... The positional advantage of having access to all other regions may make the attendant risks more palatable." Something that caught one's eye is a dim blue light in the sky-piercing 'natural' structure far away, in yet another scene; though one can't recognize what it is.{{footnote: If you'd ask one to guess, one'd say that's "Prison Island" from Xenoblade 1. Because there's a slope to the right of that structure, at least in 2D view, that one can ascribed to one of the structure one saw in Xenoblade 1.}}</p>
<p>"I see, I see..."</p>
<hr />
<p>They found a tiny waterfall, about 3 meters high, and a small pond below. Matthew noted, "All right. This'll be a good place for a rest."</p>
<p>A scanned the sky, observed stars, and noted, "Night, has caught up with us. We had better make haste setting up camp."</p>
<hr />
<p>One bed on each side of the campfire. A was far asleep, at least it seems so, while Matthew laid on his side, his elbow bent such that his head can rest on <em>that</em> hand's palm, watching the fire. But his mind was on something else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Huh huh huh huh huh huh <strong>NA'EL!!! GRANDAD!!!</strong>" He was running towards the central stage, where fire swallowed a few people, and burning rubble. He cared not of the stench; his attention was on something much more important.</p>
<p>"Huh..." Just in time to see a golden-mask golden-armor Moebius with an X in his chest{{footnote: One'll not introduce this guy first, even in this footnote, to avoid spoilers. He'll prove important.}} thrusting his katana straight at the chest of a gray-robe old man.</p>
<p>The old man, both his hands on the sword thrusted inside him, spoke effetely, "<em>Matthew...</em>"{{footnote: Italics meant <em>speaking softly/effetely.</em>}}</p>
<p>Matthew dashed towards him, "<strong>GRANDAD...!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Take care of Na'el... the future..." His speech became faster and faster while Ouroboros power was swallowing him. His soul was being pushed out of his husk as it glows brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>"<strong>GRANDAD!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>It's in your hands, Matthew!</strong>" A burst so strong pushed outwards that engulfed the three of them; and those figures in the flames, those many, and Na'el, the cat-eared girl from earlier, stood outside the flames, watching Grandad and Matthew. The flames suddenly released a great burst of energy that pushed into the air{{footnote: One guesses this is some kind of random teleportation device that'll send everyone in every single direction individually and randomly.}} while the Ouroboros flames swallowed everything in its vicinity, including the flame pillars.</p>
<p>"<strong>AAAAAARRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Urgh..." And he switched to the other side, feeling disquieted. While he wasn't looking, A raised her head and looked at him for a moment before going back to sleep. The sounds of insect and birds chirping are all there was. He had to take it himself; no one could help him out if he can't help himself.</p>
<p>On some other places, someone was running for their dear life, panting hard. "Heh heh heh heh heh heh...." Grass everywhere. There were 3 of them. In the darkness, we can't see who they are. Behind them were Kevesi soldiers and Levnises going after them, holding up torches. They knelt down, hid behind a rock, perhaps realize they'll die today.</p>
<p>But hey, something blasted at the Kevesi just after they sat down, and the screams of "AAARRRRGGGHHHHH" disrupted the silent night. After it went dead, one of them got up to check the situation. (S)He saw only burning rubble and light-lit flames. "Hooo... <strong>HURGGGHHH!!!</strong>" They don't even had time to relax; some fiery dogs, its paws lit with flames, had surrounded them.  A short-haired silver-hair female with cat ears, with some God-like wings on her shoulders, walked from behind the dogs, not fearing the flames that <em>does not</em> scorch her feet. She had a cross crystal on her chest like that hanging from A's earring. As she walked, the remnants of the corpses turned into dust wherever she stepped. Their fate had been sealed.</p>
<hr />
<p>A pile of burnt logs left in the morning. He sat up, cross-legged on his sleeping bag. She was at the pond, unsure if she was refilling water, looking at her reflection, or what.</p>
<p>"Urgggg ahhh..." As he stretched, A got up from a knelt position and walked towards him, complaining,</p>
<p>"The sun's already hanging high in the sky, Matthew."</p>
<p>He stood up, replying, "S'pose I should thank you then, for letting me sleep in."</p>
<p>"Sleeping on the ground... I've never seen <em>anyone</em> make it look quite so <em>comfortable. I worry...</em>"</p>
<p>He explained, eyes on the ground, "Grandad and I did a lot of... camping out, back when I was a kid, I mean. It don't bother me." And he got down to roll his sleeping bag while A looked away.</p>
<p>"Beep beep" Suddenly, something on the terminal alerted them. "Huh?" Matthew stood up to pull out his terminal. A got nearer to him to check what news. "Blink..." And there was an extra red dot on the map in their vicinity, aside the green dot signaling their current location.</p>
<p>"What's that signal?"</p>
<p>"Ping from a City Iris..." As he tucked it back into his pocket, he felt the strong urge after so many failed attempts, finally, he saw light, "<strong>C'MON, A!!!</strong>" And they dashed towards the indicated location.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just in time to see a City dweller's corpse evaporating into golden motes.{{footnote: When people here die, they evaporate into motes of different colors: golden, blue, red...}} "Ohhh..." He slowly walked over, knelt down on one feet, and reminisced the golden motes that floated up to the sky.</p>
<p>A also knelt down and examined the wounds before it disappeared, observed, "Judging by the wounds, it probably wasn't Moebius. Probably monsters, caught him unawares." The corpse had disappeared, only the shirt, gauntlet, and other wearables remain. Standing up, she apologized, "I'm sorry. This is my fault. If I woke you up, you might've made it."</p>
<p>He punched on the ground immediately, which surprised her,"<strong>HUH!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>It isn't your fault, A. <strong>I</strong> shouldn't've been dozing like a div. We could've helped you, friend... I'm sorry...</em>" And he closed his eyes and reminisced for a moment. A kept quiet and just stayed beside him, accompanied him while he reminisced.</p>

<p>Agnians and Kevesis exchanging hits. Not the time for Ferronises to join the battle yet; but soldiers and Levnises? The fallen engulfed in flames, but flames leaves not they proceed on. Slashes and cuts, shots and snipes, red motes rose from the dead.</p>
<p>"Huurrrrggghhhh..." One Kevesi, a young guy with bright turquoise iris, having some mechanical goggles latched on top of his head, and having mechanical arms attached to his back, fair skinned, sharp chin, and blonde hair that cover his forehead and ears, gasped in horror as one of the sword pierced right into the ground in front of him. He backed a few steps, noticing a soldier coming for him, "Oh..."</p>
<p>He immediately turned and ran for dear life. A shot blasted right before him, stopped him on the track. He switched to his left, make for another dash. Any shots to his left and right, he cared to ignore if he's outside the inner range, excluding the spattering dirt. He reached some fallen wreckage, seemingly a broken Levnis part, jumped over it, and immediately had his track lost. He backed a little, watching the sky, hearing the sounds, tried his hardest to duck under the debris, hopefully unseen by any.</p>
<p>More Kevesi soldiers joining the fight, one shouting, "<strong>Hold those positions! They get through... left flank's good as snuffed!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yaa!</strong>" And they dashed toward an incoming Agnian Levnis.</p>
<p>The 'coward' heard them. "<strong>Yaaahhhhhrrrggghhh</strong>" He covered his ears; their flesh slaughtered rang loud and clear. He pushed his body nearer to his feet, to duck deeper into the debris. More and more, the Kevesi lose the numbers. Eventually, the Agnian thrust forward.</p>
<p>On the main battlefield, one female Agnian soldier wearing red short skirt, with a green crystal like that of A's earrings, carved into her chest, wearing a helmet, dashed towards the frontline. She swung her spear/lance in the air for a few rounds, "<strong>YAAAAAHHHH</strong>" before slashing down a Kevesi soldier.</p>
<p>"<strong>ARRRRGGHHHHH...</strong>" And immediately he passed away. Red motes rose from his remains.</p>
<p>She took off her helmet with a relieved sigh. "Hurggghhh..." Red hair tied into a pony tail reaching her thigh, and some shorter ones scattered to both sides reaching her shoulders, and covers the forehead. Her dark brown iris opened big and wide. Fair skinned. She wore some Agnian-colored bands that strapped above her forehead{{footnote: Where do you usually put your glasses/sunglasses when put pull them up?}}. Perhaps, she was relieved to win the war. She scanned for any standing Kevesis. Footsteps behind, she turned around to meet 2 Agnians catching up with her, questioned, "That 'em all?"</p>
<p>"The right flank's been scoured pretty clean. <strong>Only thing left's</strong> the Ferronis in the rear." A giant turtle-like Kevesi Ferronis stood; it's Flame Clock still burning.{{footnote: If all soldiers die, the Flame Clock die, and the Flame Clock, being the 'engine' of the Ferronis, if it dies, the Ferronis will lose 'electricity' and fall to the ground.}}</p>
<p>"Right. Back to the main unit, then-... Huh..." She was alerted; to her right, the 'coward' was backing up further in to the debris.</p>
<p>"Kevesi?" One of the reporting Agnian soldier stated. "It's a miracle there's any left standing!" The three closed in; he stood up. No mechanical arm were behind, replaced by a giant metal box he tucked to his back. "What's wrong with 'im? Why's he unarmed?"</p>
<p>"<strong>HA!</strong> Not even a Blade or nuffin'..." laughed the other reporting soldier. The boy was whimpering and shaking, stuttering breathe, as if the day's chilly. They don't stop demoralizing, "Look at 'is li'l face. Heheheheheh..."</p>
<p>"Ahahahahahah!"</p>
<p>"Make it quick." The girl ordered. "We can't afford to waste time on a runt like him."</p>
<hr />
<p>Matthew and A barely exited Vermillon woods; lush brown was all they saw. Oh, and the rocks and stone, and the dendrites-like trees. A puddle of water left in the dented soil; unsure why grass did not grew everywhere. Explosions from far away shook the floor; the puddle jiggles, the feet stopped.</p>
<p>"Huh?" More shots, more explosions, more shaking, more shockwaves.  "Explosions? A battle." He concluded after listening carefully the signs.</p>
<p>"Yes. It would seem that... someone's fighting up ahead," she agreed.</p>
<p>"Remnants?"</p>
<p>"It could be. The sounds, and the shaking... I'd say, it's rather major."</p>
<p>"Hurrrghhh..." And out he dashed towards the source.</p>
<p>She raised her tone in a hush, "<strong>Hey, Matthew!</strong>"</p>
<p>He abruptly halted, turned around, announced, "<strong>I'll go check it out!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Don't be a hero. If the skirmish is <strong>nothing to do with us</strong>..."</p>
<p>"Leave it well alone, yeah? I know the drill." And he already dashed off into the distance.</p>
<p>A shook her head. Nope, he don't know the drill. "<em>Yeahhh, not holding my breath.</em>" And she went after him.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Huh! Huh! Hah! Huh... What is that? That weapon...? Can't be a Blade..." The mechanical arm punched through one of the soldiers; so hard he rolled in like a shrimp.</p>
<p>"<strong>Arrrrgghhh!!!</strong>" No soldiers yet reached his flesh, but they exhausted him. Only the girl left standing, not yet joining. He clenched the arms of the mechanics, the fist shall punch if she proves harming.</p>
<p>"Huh...?!" Stood still, both of you. Something on the main battlefield their attention turned to. Forward, forward, forward, marched the soldiers and the Levnises. The Agnian Ferronis prepared its final blow as it close in. Closer and closer, they reached its foot. No more standing Kevesis could snatch victory from their hands. Or could they? They had gone closed enough, all of them except the two watching. The Kevesi Ferronis gathered blue-motes energy in front of its Flame Clock; their marching does not stop. Bigger and bigger the ball aggregates, till it zipped a laser-like line, from bottom to top. No shouts, no dodges, no escape; flames engulfed them in a painless death. The trail it left, corpses melt into lava that scorches the floor. The end of the trail sliced the Agnian Ferronis's right wing flat and clean, and it came crashing onto the floor. The late explosion on the shoulder perhaps wiped the rest clean.</p>
<p>The red-haired girl covered her face as the bright sun-like explosion shone; and shield from the wind and dust that brushed through, drying her eyes and her lips and her nose. After she felt safe to opened and look, what she saw she gasped and (felt) shocked.</p>
<p>The 'coward' lose his shaking tone, announced, "<em>We... We take this one.</em>"</p>
<p>"How...?" She couldn't believe her eyes.</p>
<p>All plans can now be told, for an executed plan is no longer a plan, but a learning history. "So long as we can hold the flanks... the colony will mop up. New armament. All went... as planned."</p>
<p>"Grh..."</p>
<p>"And now it's curtains."</p>
<p>"<strong>SHUT UP!!!</strong>" Not till she fall. She dashed to him, slashed down while he blocked.</p>
<hr />
<p>Matthew and A were closing in onto the battlefield when a blue beam sliced in front of them. "<strong>WHOA!!!</strong>" The flames rose so high, that chilly morning turned bright noon. Where they stopped were meters from the zone, he exclaimed, "<strong>Flippin' close one!</strong>"</p>
<p>"I thought you said you knew the drill? Hold back. It looks to be a feud between colonies anyway." To prove herself, she dashed towards a clearer view, which he followed. The thick dust could not shroud their views on the Ferronises, still standing. Nearer on the ground below, "Over there..." His eyes fixated on the two exchanging slashes and punches. "Is it just those two left? No one else?"</p>
<p>A scanned the vicinity, affirmed, "No one. Mutual destruction.{{footnote: It's unsure how her X-ray eyes could looked through all obstacles and enshrouding flames and smokes to confirm the numbers.}} The battle has already come and gone."</p>
<p>"Then why are they still fighting?"</p>
<p>"It's just who they are. Nothing for us to get involved with. Pull back. Moebius will notice." And he dashed off, towards the descending ledge, that disrupt her cool, "<strong>Oh, come on!!!</strong> Matthew!"</p>
<p>"<strong>I'm not just gonna stand aside! They're only kids! I'll put an end to it! I have to!</strong>"{{footnote: Yeah, you <em>know</em> the drill...}}</p>
<p>"Moebius are always present for the aftermath!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Then that Moebius is getting a socking!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Both of them?!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Then I'll make it a two-fer!</strong>" Without further adieu, he ran towards the destination.</p>
<p>"Urghhh..." She should've known. "Oh, to hell with it..." And she tracked her de-facto partner.</p>
<p>"Ugh huh huh huh" Despite exhausted, they still <em>have to</em> fight; not till their enemies fall before their eyes.</p>
<p>"<strong>All right, break it up! The hell are you two playing at?</strong>" Their attention turned from each other to Matthew. He jumped as he talked, activated the power of Ouroboros, and aimed it on the ground between them. "<strong>You wanna scrap... you scrap with me!</strong>" It threw the two up into the air, pushed their soul out of their husk, changed the Flame Clock symbol in their Iris to that of Ouroboros, and fell with their soul back in their body, dragging along the ground.</p>
<p>Immediately, the girl struggled to get up, her blade laid in front of her, out of her grip. In an instance, she grabbed and swung it at Matthew, whom dodged adeptly. "<strong>I told you to cut it out!</strong>" He gripped so hard her spear shattered; and his hands reached for the back of her neck, lifted her above the ground. She tucked her hands behind her neck, trying to free the grip that don't break. The 'coward' lifted himself off the ground, his eyes intensely targeting his new 'enemy'. Not waiting for him to take action, "<strong>Yeah, and you,</strong>" Matthew threw the girl that slammed at him. The back of his surprised face kissed the floor, the girl sealed him from getting free.</p>
<p>"Phenomenal... Now you've gone and done it." A entered after Matthew had did his job, just in time for the slightly recovered two to get up on their feet. With resummoned blades, this time, they no longer fight each other; an '<em>us</em>' had been temporarily created, and together shall they face the unknown.</p>
<p>"I guess words ain't getting through to 'em."</p>
<p>"Odd. You've such a way with words."</p>
<p>Clenching his fist, "If they won't listen... <em>I'll make 'em listen with my</em> <strong>fists!</strong>"</p>
<p>Shaking her head, "<em>Phenomenal...</em>" And she joined the battle.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Urgh..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Harrrggghhhh...</strong>" The 'coward' dashed towards A while the girl looked at him. Hearing footsteps, she looked and saw Matthew landing a punch on her. Trying to block with her blade only shattered it. His running stance made him unstable; A easily jumped and timed her slicing; he flew back to where he was before. She struggled to stand up, trying to resummon her blade.</p>
<p>"Persistent..." Matthew didn't gave her a chance, shattered it during the process. He tried to help her, but Matthew was behind him, detached his robot arm from his back and kicked him to the ground. "Chill out, will you?!" And he actually knew how to sheathed it back into a metal box, to which he dropped it behind him, and sat down on it.</p>
<p>To his left knelt the girl, to his right knelt the 'coward', and A watched from his 2 o'clock. Defenseless, now conversation can start, with the girl being one step fast(er), "What... What are you, goon?"</p>
<p>"I was beginning to think you'd never ask."</p>
<p>"Uh..." She was surprised.</p>
<p>"I'm Matthew, from the City." And he signaled to his partner, introduced, "And this is A."</p>
<p>"'City'...? Huh?" Never heard before.</p>
<p>"I guess you lot would probably think of us as enemies... But we're your allies... in a sense..."</p>
<p>The 'coward' prompted for more, "Our allies?"</p>
<p>"Our <strong>real</strong> enemy... <em>It isn't each other.</em>"</p>
<p>Both of them: "Huuuh???" What're you even talking about?</p>
<p>A announced, "They're here..."</p>
<p>"Right on cue..." And he stood up, ready for another round. "Nice of our real enemies to drop by. <strong>You</strong> just sit tight, while <strong>we</strong> take care of 'em, aight? Trust me on this one." The purple motes were gathering in front of them faster and faster.</p>
<p>Now that his attention was diverted, the 'coward' ran towards his giant hand mechanism to check it out, while the girl watched Matthew and A, to see what they're talking about.</p>
<p>A spider-head Consul appeared in the scene, started the observation, "Hey now! <strong>What do you think you're doing? The show was just getting good.</strong>" She walked nearer to the two.</p>
<p>On the other side, a hard-head chicken-crest-headed Consul walked after she finished her sentence, added, "<strong>And you've fully screwed up our wager to BOOT.</strong>"</p>
<p>Matthew: "Oh, I'm sorry, did I spoil your fun?" Folding his hands, "You really are a bunch of sickos, you lot."</p>
<p>"<strong>He doesn't seem like a soldier.</strong>" The spider-woman observed. "<strong>Who are you?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh... My Iris. Check it, and weep." And he showed the Ouroboros symbol.</p>
<p>With a shaky tone, "<em>What in the-?! Ou-Ouroboros?!</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>A City refugee...</em> Moebius Hunter?!"</p>
<p>"'Moebius Hunter'?" Now that's a term he'd never heard of. "You what?" He turned to look at A. "Wait, is that what they call us these days?"</p>
<p>She looked away, as if <em>really</em> thinking hard about it, with a hush tone, "No idea. I don't recall 'hunting' any... Just cleaning up the mess you always end up making. Bailing you out of trouble."{{footnote: Yeeeeaaahhh... <em>cleaning</em>...}}</p>
<p>"Exactly... OK, anyway. Those two kids over there. They're in our <em>custody now.</em>" The 'coward' had his weapon back on his back, standing beside the knelt-down girl looking at their conversations.</p>
<p>The chicken-head questioned, "<strong>Custody</strong>, you say? <strong>HAHAHAHAHAH... You sound like you think you can take ON US. This mighty pairing of Moebius Q and R!</strong>" And both transformed into their Moebius form.</p>
<p>"Obviously?" The 'coward' had summoned his giant hand once again, to at least defend himself, seeing such new monsters he'd never seen in his life. The girl was still on the floor. A and Matthew hadn't deactivated their weapons anyway. "After all, gotta live up to our new nickname!"</p>
<hr />
<p>She dragged along the floor, put a few steps behind. Pant, pant, pant. Cracking his knuckles, "Alrighty... We just gotta smash the core... and the job's a good 'un." The first target? The chicken head.{{footnote: Unsure if he's Q or R...}}. The chicken head stood up; not dying knelt down. The others watched.</p>
<p>Still on the ground, the red-haired girl heard something. "<em><strong>Glimmer</strong>... My beloved soldier...</em>" The woman Moebius was whispering into her ears. "<em>He isn't paying attention to you. It's your chance to strike.</em>" She watched him twisting his neck, cracking his fist. "<em>On my mark... attack.</em>"</p>
<p>"Mhm..." Still faithful to her colony, she agreed. Slow and steady, her spear materialize, alerting only the 'coward' whose eyes were long on her. He gripped his fist to punch the chicken head. "<strong><em>NOW!!!</em></strong>" And she launched herself.</p>
<p>"Ngh..." The 'coward' don't know what to say.</p>
<p>"Ohh..." Matthew reacted fast, twisted and blocked her attacks. Unprepared, the sparring wasn't as easy as before. "<strong>Whoa, easy now! There's no need to fight me!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ahahaha!", laughed the female Moebius. slowly retreating with the chicken head, "That's right, you play your little game of tag... We'll just pop back home, and once we're healed up, we'll- <strong>ORGGGHHHHH!!!</strong>" A sharp, shiny blade thrusted through her core. Dark energy leaked from the wounds.</p>
<p>Her face was calm as ever. "I don't normally stoop to this. Such duplicity is beneath me." Her sword, originally totally red, had now changed form; it's blade shiny and icy; the ring on the Ricasso displayed a symbol: 斬 (slice from up to down). Only a Monado possessed such symbols.</p>
<p>"<strong>S-s-stabbed in the back...? What a...</strong> dirty ruse..." She pulled out her sword; she evaporated into blue motes immediately. The chicken head came after her; she waited for the right distance, twisted and sliced through his core.</p>
<p>"<strong>OAGGGGGGG!!</strong>" And he knelt down, losing power. "No... That... sword...!" He saw the symbol. She put the shackles back on in front of his eyes; the light and symbol died down therefore. Blue motes gently rose from his body, he could live no longer.</p>
<p>Matthew haven't solved Glimmer yet. Concerned, her attention diverted, "<strong>Lady Consul...!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Argh..." The 'coward' watched his leader died, but took no action.</p>
<p>Blocking one of her attacks, he shouted, "<strong>A! To you!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Way ahead of you!" She dashed towards one of the Ferronis, activating her sword's symbol once more, "Hurgggg! <strong>Huaaaarrrggghhh!!!</strong>" Down she sliced, red motes escaped the Flame Clock. Like a frog, she jumped off the bottom as it sprayed like a cut artery. The 'coward''s mouth wide opened, can't believe his eyes. Moving swiftly, she jumped once more, pierced her sword into the other Flame Clock, and sliced it once more. The Flame Clocks, aiming at each other, seemed like mixing blood, spraying at each other. Losing energy to even stand, they collapsed under the pull of gravity. The 'coward' and the red-haired girl, their iris Flame Clock dimmed, replaced by an Ouroboros symbol, and they effetely fell, losing consciousness. Near her, Matthew managed to grab her before she collapsed hard. The 'coward' wasn't that lucky, dropped to the ground, 'protected' by his mechanical arms.</p>
<p>Putting her on the ground, he wiped the sweat on his forehead, "<strong>Whoo...</strong> Just one thing after another, innit?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure you're feeling pleased with yourself..." She'd returned, stopping a distance away. "But I wish you'd spare a thought for me as well. You realize, all this takes a toll on me."</p>
<p>"I know, I know." And he closed in on her, held out his fist, asking for a punch. And his smile, they don't disappear despite.</p>
<p>"Hmph..." And she walked to arm-length and return the punch. Welcome to the age of hyper-cooperative apes!</p>
<hr />
<p>"<strong>ARRRRRGGGGHHHH UNGHHHHH...</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Stop running! You coward!</strong>"</p>
<p>Waking up, the Agnian and Kevesi were fighting again. Actually, it's Glimmer catching after him.</p>
<p>Just returning to the camp at dusk, Matthew held to the legs of an animal; A hugged a sack. "Phenomenal..."</p>
<p>"There we go, what'd I tell you? One of us shoulda watched 'em."</p>
<p>"You also told me you wanted us to secure as much food as possible." Such conflicting goals, eh!</p>
<p>He was on the ground, Glimmer bashing on him. His mechanical arms timed her; grabbed it tight; she can't pull it out. "So, ideas?"</p>
<p>"Oh, very well. I'll handle it." She put down the sack, drew her weapon, and knocked both of them on their belly with its hilt.</p>
<p>Matthew be the one doing the speaking, "<strong>Right, time out!</strong> That'll be enough out of you two. <strong>Your</strong> fighting days are over."</p>
<p>"<em>What?</em>" Glimmer can't believed what he just said.</p>
<p>"The Moebius... Or, <em>uh, I guess</em> you'd call them the Consuls, right? <em>Well, they're dust in the wind,</em> the Flame Clocks are in pieces... and your Iris Clocks... They're gone, aren't they?" Ever since being hit by the power of Ouroboros, their Iris Clocks had transformed into Ouroboros symbols.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Both was surprised at the bland truth.</p>
<p>"You're done. No need to fight any more. No need to take life, or fear its loss."</p>
<p>Glimmer, the one less fearful of wars, asked with shaky tone, "You're not serious...?"</p>
<p>"Give it a couple of days for it to sink in. Your life's stopped draining. And that means you don't have to fight. All you're gonna need now... is a bite to eat." And he threw the game beside the campfire.</p>
<hr />
<p>It'd been cut into pieces and the balls are joined by a piece of stick, like satay, and put beside the campfire for baking. One on each side, north east south west, they sat. Matthew picked up two skewers of roasted game and passed it to the two, "Gw'an{{footnote: "Go on."}}." The 'coward' took one from him, while Glimmer faced away, not taking it. "Wow, aren't we stubborn. It's your loss." And he took a bite from the remaining himself.</p>
<p>A, sitting in front of the 'coward', watched him ravenously chomping down the food. Glimmer questioned, full of emotions, "<strong>Why did you do that...?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>She jumped from her seat, "<strong>I was so close... I WAS SO CLOSE TO FINALLY COMING HOME!!!</strong>" She turned to show the term symbol on her right shoulder, almost all grayed out.</p>
<p>Calmly, he replied, "I'm... not sure I follow...?"</p>
<p>"<strong>MY OFFERING! I WAS GOING TO GIVE MY LIFE! FOR MY COMRADES? KILLED BY THIS FILTH!</strong>" She turned to refer to the 'coward'. "<strong>IF I COULD JUST MAKE IT HOME, IT WOULD MEAN SOMETHING...!!! THAT...</strong>" She shook her head, "<strong>THAT'S THE ONLY THING I'VE ever wanted... To fight, to come Home...</strong>" And she slowly knelt down, eyes over her crossed arms, to cover her tears, "<em>And you... You... <strong>took it</strong>.</em> Ungh..."</p>
<p>The 'coward' had nothing to say. A questioned, "This fight of yours. Who was it that forced it upon you?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Both were surprised.</p>
<p>"Think about it. You have all the pieces."</p>
<p>"Nikol, and..." Nikol also had a single red dot with all others grayed out in his term symbol, also nearing his homecoming. "Glimmer, right?" Matthew asked, reading the dog tag on her arm. He took another skewer of meat and hand it to her, addressed, "You're both starving. Can't think straight on an empty tum. Eh?"</p>
<p>She looked up. This time, she took it softly from him. And Nikol continued eating.</p>
<hr />
<p>Night falls. They made bed NESW. A and Matthew were far asleep. Nikol dropped his gadget by his bedside, too tired to be awake. She seem asleep, but her eyes wide awoke. Then, she softly got up, alerting 'no one', and ran off into the distance. A was never totally asleep; she heard her footsteps and opened her eyes, saw it's her dashing off rather than danger approaching, then closed back her eyes, continued sleeping.</p>

<p>A metallic-looking City surrounded by high, sturdy walls. It had the watchtower-like pillars at its corners, metal fences by the edges of the top floor. The tall entrance, capable of accepting tall vehicles to pass through, were closed. Just outside the entrance stood two figures, training. The third sat on a chair overlooking them. "Pliph" Simultaneously, they punched. "Hoigh hoigh! Hoigh! Hurgh!" And a series of movements followed. The old man watched attentively at Matthew and Na'el, finding any tiniest faults, if any.</p>
<p>Grandad was old, all wrinkled, thick creasy eyelids with fluorescent green iris, white hair and white moustache.</p>
<p>"<strong>HUAAAAA!!!</strong>" They drew back their fist and released their Qi{{footnote: internal energy}} as it evaporates off the surface of their skin. Matthew glowed green, Na'el bright orange. The Ouroboros symbol came into existence in their irises. Then, they punched, emitting a ball of energy forward. "Huuuhhh..." Finishing move returned their Qi to their Dan Tian{{footnote: 丹田}}.</p>
<p>"Your power was expertly balanced. Well done. You've both made great strides." Proud of his praises, eh! "But a real battle is unlike anything else. You can't just hope for the best." He then stood up and walked towards them, signaling, "Come at me..." And he summoned his Ouroboros power to fight both of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the way, Grandad's name is <strong>Ghondor.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Urghhh..." One hit at Matthew's belly and he fell to the ground. Na'el was exhausted.{{footnote: Grandpa finished with the Chinese stance for hello/bye after you fight someone, with fist on right, and left palm wrapped around it.}} Folded his arms, he asked, "Well?"</p>
<p>"'Well'? Don't gimme that!" And he got up from the ground. "That was cruel, Grandad."{{footnote: It rhymes!}}</p>
<p>"He's right." Na'el agreed, adding, "Countering the moment we unleash our power's just rude!"</p>
<p>"<strong><em>When your concentration is lacking, the body, and spirit drift apart.</em></strong> Only when you've mastered the power of Ouroboros will you find balance. Nay, you will become one, with your very selves."</p>
<p>Matthew asked, "Uh..., so, this, incredible- power- of yours... Anyone ever actually been able to master it?"</p>
<p>"...Nay."</p>
<p>Na'el: "Knew it. Even you fell short, Grandad?"</p>
<p>"Mmm... My parents, however... It is said that they were a, breath away, from success."</p>
<p>"The ones in the photo?" A guy dressed in black, with pointed chin, thin lips, laid beside the bed where his wife, with silver hair and cat ears, pointed chin, holding a baby in her arms.{{footnote: If you'd watched/read Xenoblade 3 main story, you'd know they're Noah and Mio, respectively. <strong>Translator's note:</strong> It's a wonder who named him Ghondor, though, considering that the other Ghondor hated her name.}}</p>
<p>"Our great-grandad and grandma, right? That'll have been a proper while ago. <strong>I bet that's why.</strong> Everyone in the City must think we're a bunch of clowns."</p>
<p>"Whuh? You think so?" Na'el was surprised at his viewpoint.</p>
<p>"Yeah, like, 'get with the times!' We're stuck with these <em>wibbly</em> Ouroboros powers... <strong>Everyone's rocking those sweet new amps.</strong> It really opens up the options for your Blade. So yeah, nobody uses the Ouroboros stuff any more..."</p>
<p>Grandad disagreed, "Nobody thinks we're clowns, Matthew." Then, he imitate, "'Woweeee... Those guys are some real sticklers for tradition, eh?' That's about the extent of it."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but that's the same as calling us 'clowns'!"</p>
<p>"Mmmmm... It is not. The very reason the City exists, is because, <strong>those</strong> who gained the power of Ouroboros, confronted Moebius long ago."</p>
<p>Na'el added, "<strong>And</strong>, it's because of them that lots of soldiers were freed from the system, banded together... and then founded the City... Right?"</p>
<p>"Mm."</p>
<p>"We musta heard it dozens of times now. Eh?" Na'el said in a teasing tone.</p>
<p>Matthew agreed, teasingly added, "Other kids got lullabies... Wish we could've traded places."</p>
<p>"Hmph hmph..." laughed Na'el.</p>
<p>"Mmm...."</p>
<p>"I haven't forgotten... About how Mum and Dad... died in the last battle against Moebius, 15 years ago."</p>
<p>"Mm..." Na'el agreed with him. "They gave us this. This time of peace we get to enjoy."</p>
<p>Slightly nodding his head, Grandpa added, "And you must never forget that, you hear me? <strong><em>The only true end... is the moment that you give up.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>Just then, a bunch of kids were running towards them, shouting, "<strong>Na'el!</strong>"</p>
<p>They turned towards them, and she was smiling. Matthew commented, "<strong>Huh?</strong> So much for our time of peace."</p>
<p>The leading kid, blonde hair, bright green iris, commented, "This is where you were! And you fighting with your grandad again? <strong>You can't do that!</strong>" Grandpa was just smiling and nodding watching them. "<strong>You promised!</strong> You said you'd play piano for us after the nap!"</p>
<p>She knelt down to level her head with the kid's. "<strong>Ah,</strong> sorry, of course. I'll be with you in <strong>just</strong> a minute."</p>
<p>Putting her hands around her waist, she rebutted, "<strong>No, not a minute! Now!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urggghhh... Yes, all right. I'm at your behest <em>huh</em>..." She turned to nod at Matthew and Grandad, and both adjourned her.</p>
<p>While she walked off with them, many dancing except the leading girl which walked beside her, Na'el asked, "What song would you like?"</p>
<p>"Gaur Plain!"</p>
<p>Another kid shouted, "Tomorrow With You!"</p>
<p>Yet another, "Bringer of Chaos, Ultimate!"</p>
<p>"<strong>All</strong> of them?"</p>
<p>"<strong>All of them!</strong>" All of them shouted.</p>
<p>"If I must. From the top, then."</p>
<p>"<strong>Yaaaaayyyy!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"You can relax," he said as they were watching them off. "I'm on it. I'll protect her, I swear."</p>
<hr />
<p>"Mm mhm... Uhm..."</p>
<p>"Mm hmm?" Still deep in sleep when sun's already high up. A coughing tone woke him up, opening his eyes and saw Nikol looming over him.</p>
<p>"Well... Um, sir..."</p>
<p>"Matthew's fine. Urghhh, arggghhh..." And he stretched, prepared to wake up.</p>
<p>"Matthew, she's gone."</p>
<p>"Huh?" What the heck are you talking about? Rubbing his eyes, he asked for clarification, "Who's what now?"</p>
<p>"That girl... The soldier from Agnus, Glimmer." A was standing beside him to watch his reaction.</p>
<p>And he no longer rubbed his eyes, jumped up from bed, shouted, "<strong>SERIOUSLY?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Fully awoken, the three were looking at a path that leads to the other side of the battlefield. "When did it happen?" Matthew asked.</p>
<p>As the only one who saw her left, she replied, "It'll have been shortly before dawn... Five o'clock, give or take."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? Five, huh?" Then he jumped on her, "<strong>Hey! You could've said something!</strong>"</p>
<p>"You would have stopped her."</p>
<p>"<strong>Well, no shit!</strong>"</p>
<p>"This is her personal matter. Even the most impassioned speeches may fail to persuade."</p>
<p>"Sounds like a loser talk." His hand folded, unhappy the decision she'd made.</p>
<p>"I believe <em>you</em> said something to that effect."</p>
<p>"<strong>Uh, did not!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Did too. Like yesterday? 'I guess words aren't getting through to them.' Eh? You said it."</p>
<p>And his eyes wide opened at the example she gave. "Urhhh...Ngh..." Couldn't rebut. Then, he put his palm over a fist, said, "Uh... Let's just get going!"</p>
<p>Nikol questioned, "But where, to?"</p>
<p>"<strong>After her, of course. Glimmer. If she meets with a colony, she's stuffed.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Um... How stuffed, exactly?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Might find out soon enough...</strong> Er, but <strong>not if we can</strong> help it. <strong>WE GOING OR WHAT?</strong>" And he took the lead, Nikol followed, while A watched.</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>" Not that she could change his mind when he'd made a choice.</p>
<hr />
<p>Passing through one campside, still on the barren path, A stopped and asked, "Matthew. Any clues as to where she might have gone?"</p>
<p>He stopped and turned to her, "Huh? How should I know? Let's just comb the area, yeah? Leave no stone unturned!"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>" What a suggestion. After shaking her head, she suggested, "If we assume she's trying to return to her own troops, she'll likely have headed north-west. That whole area is Agnian territory. It's very probable that a colony would be stationed there. Save for perhaps your hair, there's little need to comb anything. Did you follow that, Matthew?"</p>
<p>"Wow, A, you are so clever.{{footnote: Ahahaha! You didn't even bother to analyze.}} <strong>Truly, your intellect knows no bounds.</strong> So, we go north-west then?" Seeing that Nikol was not saying anything, looking on the ground, he suggested, "You too, c'mon. You'll be safer if you stick with us."</p>
<p>Reluctantly and hesitantly, "<em>Urhhhh...</em>"</p>
<p>"All right, yeah, I know that might sound rich, coming from me... <em>But would you <strong>please</strong>, just take my word for it for now?</em>"</p>
<p>"A-a-all right..." And so they have a direction.</p>

<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Falling waterfall down to a pond, where lush green trees and grass grew along its edge. The smooth part of the land reflects the moonlight shone to it, even in stormy weather. There laid other remnants that proved civilization existed long ago, but had been abandoned, dilapidated, and turned into ruins. Some giant leaves that stuck to a giant trunk glowed fluorescent green in the dark. The area where this glowing tree resides was thick with black fog. Red 'chains' (the seeds? the flowers?) hung from the tip of some branches of the glowing tree. Only one location do we see artificial light, but not near enough to ascertain what building it is. This, is <strong>Aurora Shelf.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>{{footnote: This is also in the 2nd video only, environment talk that is.}}</p>
<p>Reaching the area where the huge red-leaves tree standing amongst the lush greens, the red leaves glowed red hot; even falling leaves looked like burning flickers against the night sky. Matthew said, "Looking out at it like this, you really gotta admit, this world is <strong>crazy</strong> huge."</p>
<p>"Matthew, the world truly is vast, far more than you'll ever know, and filled with mystery." The red glowing tree stood single on top of a ledge, where a colosseum-like remnants, just an arc left, circled around one side of it. The plain was hilly, and there were other tree silhouette that did not display itself against the night sky. "And while we're not currently in the position to travel it at our leisure... One day soon, you should let your feet walk it from end to end. You would stand to gain much from the experience." A suggested, adding, "Who knows? You may even discover a new land for the people of the City to call home."</p>
<p>"Hrmmm... You were a rover then, A?"</p>
<p>"Hah... You know, I may well have been."</p>
<p>And he complaint, "<strong>Why</strong> is everything you say so damn elusive...?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Walking between ruins toward a 'dead end'{{footnote: from our point of view.}} during a stormy day, A was alerted: "Wait."</p>
<p>"Huh? What is it, A?"</p>
<p>Then, they saw a blue-green rhino coming at them. Nikol was alerted, "Monster...! Do you think the girl is fine?"</p>
<p>"Unclear. I'd say for now, you should probably worry about yourself," A suggested.</p>
<p>Matthew was excited. "Hah, this is great! <em>Gimme gimme!</em> Lemme have a bash at this fella!"</p>
<p>"Don't get too heated up, Matthew." warned A. "This is the time for a synergy move."</p>
<p>"Aw yeah, good shout! You better follow my lead though!"</p>
<p>"Hah! Not if I can help it!" And they drew their weapons.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the final hit, Matthew used the Ouroboros power and punched it in the face, bottom to top, before it crashed onto the ground below. "<strong>BOOM!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"'Boom'? Hardly." And he turned towards her, which she complaint, "That there... was what you'd call gratuitous. The poor thing was within a cetri of its life."</p>
<p>"This old chestnut? I was quick. We won't get rumbled."</p>
<p>"You're aware we took out two Moebius yesterday? We could well be the targets of a manhunt as we speak."</p>
<p>"<strong>Then we knock 'em down some more.</strong>" says he with full confidence, looking up at the sky.</p>
<p>"There's no guarantee that you'll keep winning."</p>
<p>"Nah, but <strong>we</strong> will."</p>
<p>"<em>Think back on what you know.</em> Not all Moebius are like those two." Remember the golden face that stabbed his grandad in his chest? Even his grandad, whom wielded a far more immense power than his, was no match for him.</p>
<p>"<em>Hmph...</em>"</p>
<p>Shaking her head, "Hah..."</p>
<p>"Mm?"</p>
<p>"What's up?" Matthew asked Nikol, hearing his sigh, and both turned their heads toward him.</p>
<p>"No, nothing..."</p>
<p>"Ungh?"</p>
<p>A pushed, "Do you have something to get off your chest?"</p>
<p>"Ngh..." He looked down on the floor, not saying anything.</p>
<p>"You don't have to hold your tongue," A urged. "We were the ones who extricated you. You may hold us <strong>fully</strong> accountable."</p>
<p>Then, with some reluctance, he softly raised his finger and pointed at Matthew's gloves. "Mm."</p>
<p>"Ah? These gloves? You want 'em?"</p>
<p>"<strong>No</strong>, not what I meant... That Art... What was it?"</p>
<p>"Uhh, which Art?" After thinking for a moment, he recalled, "<strong>Ohhh,</strong> you mean the Ouroboros power? Is that it?"</p>
<p>"'Ouro-boros'...?"</p>
<p>A: "First time you've seen it. Nothing weird about being curious."</p>
<p>"It was just... wow..."</p>
<p>Matthew don't understand, "But hold on a mo'{{footnote: 'moment'.}}. You've got Blades and Arts too. Pretty much the same thing."</p>
<p>With low tone, he denied, dropped his head, "Not me... I can't..."</p>
<p>"Can't... what?"</p>
<p>A explained, "He means he can't summon a Blade. Surely you must have realized given the way he's been fighting." That's the box and arms behind him. "I hear it can be an issue with some soldiers."</p>
<p>"Ngh..."</p>
<p>Matthew was optimistic, "Uh, still, you know. All part of life's rich tapestry. <strong>No big deal</strong>, am I right?"</p>
<p>"Ngh..." He's not feeling good.</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't take them... with these. Not like you did. <em>No way.</em>"</p>
<p>"I don't follow. Uh..." He looked to A for explanations. After all, she's the one that can read emotions more clearly than him.</p>
<p>"He's talking about us defeating the Moebius."</p>
<p>"Mm..."</p>
<p>"Ohhh, now I get it. <em>Think you got it all wrong, though.</em>"</p>
<p>"Wha-...?"</p>
<p>Walking near him, he explained, "You have it now. Inside you both. This power."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Remember? Back when I freed you</strong>, with a burst of light." That's when their soul went out of their cask, and their iris changed from Flame Clocks to Ouroboros symbol. "<strong>Anyone who gets touched by that light</strong>... inherits the Ouroboros power. That's the way <strong>we</strong> got it too."</p>
<p>"<strong>What, really?</strong>" He couldn't believed his ears.</p>
<p>"Uh-huh. With a little work, I'll be able to draw out its true power..." He grip one of his hands, looked at his gloves, continued, "And then in theory, I'll be able to free others without even having to destroy their Flame Clocks. Well anyway, the rest's all up to you. <strong>It's easy. You'll get the hang of it in no time.</strong>"</p>
<p>Then, he looked at his own hands. Can he, one who can't summon a blade, really can wield such immense powers?</p>
<p>"Think about Ouroboros power is, it was created so we could smash up Moebius cores."</p>
<p>"And those are... what?"</p>
<p>"Their shiny chest whatsits. You destroy one, and it takes 'em clean out. See, my grandad's pops... He used that power, <strong>soon</strong> as it came to be, and made it so that us <em>City</em> folk... would hand it down, through the generations."</p>
<p>"'Grandad's'...? And what's a, 'pops'...?"</p>
<p>Folding his hands, "Ohh, sorry... Long story short... All this business went down, about, 70 years ago, or thereabouts."</p>
<p>"Right..."</p>
<p>He was looking down again, and Matthew raised him back. "<strong>Hey, Nikol.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"I'm gonna be... frank with you here."</p>
<p>"Mm..."</p>
<p>"Don't think yourself a burden because you ain't one. We've all got our strengths and weaknesses. No big deal. Yeah?" And he tapped him quite hard on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Nikol looked at the hand tapped on his shoulder, "Mmph..." But he wasn't looking up yet. Looks like it requires time for it to sit in with him.</p>
<hr />
<p>Such scene was already tracked by Moebius. Watching on a cinema screen in the dark room full of chairs (like a real cinema theater), the golden mask whom stabbed his grandad stood in the central alleyway, watching their interactions. The floating guy during the starting scene, fighting alongside Shulk and the other guy, against Alvis, also seated himself in the theater. Both said nothing, only watched quietly.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tracking up slope, among lush green grasses, between tall cliff rocks, Nikol suddenly stopped, calling for their attentions, "Um... ex-cuse me?"{{footnote: Behind them, there was a small waterfall to Nikol's 5 o'clock.}}</p>
<p>"What's up, Nikol?" asked Matthew.</p>
<p>"Well, um..." He pulled the straps that held his mechanical hands up, perhaps due to his nervousness.</p>
<p>Walking nearer to him, Matthew urged, "<strong>Come on, man. Enough with the umming and ahing, spit it out!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Sorry..."</p>
<p>"Matthew... You could have chosen your words more carefully."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ah! Arr, Wait, uh, scratch that!</strong> I just meant that you shouldn't be afraid to speak your mind...!"</p>
<p>"I'd... like- to make some adjustments to the operation of my backpack arms. There was an issue with mobility in the last battle against the monster... I'm... sure there'll be more fighting ahead, and I don't want to slow you guys down..."</p>
<p>"Well now..." that kept A thinking.</p>
<p>"<strong>Is that all? Relax, no worries! We can take a load off</strong> somewhere and let you tinker."</p>
<p>A scanned for the direction they were walking, suggested, "There's an open space over there. It should serve for a rest spot."</p>
<p>"Oh, er, thanks very much..."</p>
<p>Matthew added, moving one step closer to him, "And, hey, it came out weird earlier, but I really meant it -- no need to be shy with us, or hold anything back. You're not our hostage or prisoner. You know that, right?"</p>
<p>"Um... yeah... Thank you."</p>
<p>And he just showed A how he'd done it. She slightly nodded.</p>
<hr />
<p>Beside a campfire under a tree by the rocks, they watched as he tinkered with the mechanism, cranking the nuts and bolts and screws here and there. A observed, "I'm quite surprised. He's more flexible than I thought. He comprehends his situation, does his best to adapt."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? <strong>I find him kinda</strong>, I dunno, meek. And he's not much of a chatty fella..."</p>
<p>"All in life's rich tapestry, no?"</p>
<p>"Ehhh..."</p>
<p>"People are people. Not everyone's going to have a personality as <em>straight-forward</em> as yours."</p>
<p>"Uhh... You takin' the mick?"</p>
<p>"No. Call it praise... Anyway," and she changed the subject. "The real issue is our other friend."</p>
<p>"A..."</p>
<p>"Matthew?"</p>
<p>"I guess you... 'foresaw' all this, didn't you? Right from the start?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but you needed to experience it. I'll take the blame."</p>
<p>"<em>Ah, man...</em> <strong>Anyway. We'd better go and find her.</strong> Before the gal gets herself..."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<hr />
<p>At the other side; also still the same region but deeper into the 'forest' (sparse trees but denser than where Matthew and the others rested), she was panting heavily as she ran and ran and ran. "Urgh..." She touched her iris to scan the surrounding; but all it said was 'Communications down.' "Uhh, no good... <strong>Still a bit farther</strong> till comms range. <strong>HUH!!!</strong>" There was a shadow that ran past her front as she was checking her iris. Alerted, she didn't see what it was.</p>
<p>She was slightly tensed, but not yet defensive{{footnote: i.e. not yet pulling out her blade.}}. She looked to her left, to her right, scanned her surroundings. "<strong>HUH!!!</strong>" More footsteps and there were volffs{{footnote: Wolf-like creature with red manes}} that surrounded her front. "<strong>VOLFFS?!!!</strong>" And she drew her weapon to face it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Down fell the volffs; she sighed with relief after confirming the danger's over, sheathing her weapons. Suddenly, a roar came from behind as a volff poached onto her. Subconsciously, she redeemed her weapons and the power of Ouroboros naturally glowed over her, knocking off the volffs with ease. There was a dimmed outline of her soul behind her as she used the power. After sheathing her weapon once more, she looked at the killed volff, wondered aloud, "Wh... what? How did...?"</p>
<p>She looked at her hands, as if it had something different. No, nothing. She activated her iris to scan for any unviewable differences. Still nothing. But then, she recalled what Matthew said earlier,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>And your Iris Clocks... They're gone, aren't they? You're done. No need to fight any more. No need to take life, or fear its loss.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"No way... I-it's true... <strong>Huh!</strong>" She was alternating between denial and acceptance until some sound of mechanics walking behind the rocks alerted her conscious. Based on her experiences, these were "Engines... Levnises?" She quietly get behind the rock and peered over it, seeing some soldiers wearing black attires. The robots resembled more like humans than Kevesi's insects, or Agnian's floating ones; and their size were far smaller than the former two, only about 1.5x the size of a normal human. These were scanning the surrounding, together with some soldiers, while other soldiers were speaking with each other. "But they're... not Kevesi Levnises. What's that gear? From the City... like the ones we studied in the textbook? <strong>HUH!!</strong>"</p>
<p>She turned around and found herself surrounded. Footsteps were not heard when her attention was elsewhere. One of the guy wearing goggles, black gelled hair, fair skinned, wearing leather-looking gears, commented, "Ah-uh... An Agnian soldier?"</p>
<p>Another female, also wearing goggles, with green short hair, added, "Out here all alone, eh?"</p>
<p>"She's probably scouting out territory." A female walked forward in between them, towards Glimmer. Then, she looked at another blonde hair women, and they nodded to each other. The latter dashed off, while the female, tanned skin, dark hair, brown iris, with two ponytails, ordered, "We'll capture her for now, get her unit's location. Don't wanna be getting into fights with colonies right now." And Glimmer drew her blade to faced 3 soldiers alone.</p>
<p>"Urgh..."</p>
<hr />
<p>The female dashed towards Glimmer, while she blocked; but she easily knocked her blade up into the air, automatically sheathing it. No time to think of losing her weapon; she'd made another slash at her, to which she jumped backwards and dodged. It did cut her wrist, though, and what she was wearing, a symbolic decorative made of rope tied into a specific symbol, and maintained its shape with a tightened knot made of jade, dropped to the floor. "Ungh." And she pressed against where she was injured. Other soldiers closed in to ensure her surrounded.</p>
<p>"That's enough." The female ordered, walking past the surrounding soldiers towards her. Pointing her spear at her, she ordered, "You better stop resisting... or I will end you."</p>
<p>"<strong>GRRRRR...</strong>" And with her anger, the Ouroboros symbol came to light. She noticed the symbol and was full of surprise.</p>
<p>"Ahhh! <em>You're...</em>"</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Panacea? Is there a problem?" A male voice sounded from her left. Attention diverted, everyone lowered their weapons. Anger faded and Ouroboros symbol concealed. The guy, his right hand covered inside his batman-like hood, or maybe he'd lost that hand. He had long hair, untied, blonde.</p>
<p>"Ah! Teacher!"</p>
<p>"An Agnus soldier. So young." She hadn't managed to speak anything before he noted Glimmer himself.</p>
<p>Glimmer's eyes tightened. Then, Panacea explained, "Teacher, she seems to be one of <em>them</em>."</p>
<p>"'Them'...?"</p>
<p>"The Clockless..."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh</em>..."</p>
<p>And the other soldiers now mumbled behind the scene. "No Flame Clock..."</p>
<p>"So she's out of the loop, huh...?"</p>
<p>"Who could've done it...?"</p>
<p>The male: "Strange..."</p>
<p>One guy, with tanned skin, but lightly tan in the middle, darker tanned to both side of his cheeks and half of his eyes, with a golden line that run in between the darker sides and the lighter sides, green iris, short dark hair, asked, "Whaddya wanna do, Shulk?"</p>
<hr />
<p>They were walking on the lusher green ground, with all rocks lying around, and the walls of rocks curved a semicircle, plus some bushes green or autumn-like, when Matthew commented, "Uh, A... You're totally sure we're going the right way?"</p>
<p>"The region beyond here, it's under Agnian control. If we posit she wanted to rejoin her people, there's a high chance she passed through here."</p>
<p>"All right, I trust you..." But the tone wasn't very believing.</p>
<p>Nikol's eyes was scanning the surrounding when he noticed some anomalies,  "<em>Oh!</em>"</p>
<p>"Wassup?" They followed where his eyes were and saw where Glimmer was hit before.</p>
<p>"Signs of battle." noted A, then scanned for more info, "Not a full-scale army engagement... Something, smaller..."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>" Matthew walked closer to the darkened ground, taking out his terminal to check for signals. "There's a reading, but it's faint... Which means, refugees from the City?"</p>
<p>After tucking it back into his pocket, A walked to line beside him, "Perhaps. <strong>That</strong> or the girl could have been the source."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>"</p>
<p>Nikol bent down to look for more details, calling for their attention to "Here..." They saw what Glimmer had dropped on the ground during the battle before.</p>
<p>A remembered, "Definitely hers."</p>
<p>Matthew: "So... she really was here."</p>
<p>"No husk, though. It likely means... she was taken..."</p>
<p>"You think, maybe she killed 'em all? Unlike the soldier kids, we don't leave a trace after we kick the bucket."</p>
<p>"That's not possible. Given the evidence, they had the numerical advantage."</p>
<p>"Right, OK... So we follow 'em. If it <strong>is</strong> survivors from the City, they might know... something about Na'el."</p>
<p>"Indeed... I'm curious too."</p>
<hr />
<p>Their steps were easy and quick, even as grass brushed through as obstacles. Not Nikol, though. His steps were heavy, lumping forward, counting each. He held on to his mechanical arms, the weight pressing to topple him backwards. He said nothing, continued the journey if all wanted to. But Matthew saw, over his shoulder, the poor boy, and suggested aloud, "A. High time for a break."</p>
<p>She was surprised that someone so insistent would be willing to pause, turned to look what's up with him, and saw him closing in to them, stopping a distance to catch his breathe. "Got it." And he wiped the sweat off him, and they went off to set up camp.</p>
<hr />
<p>The exhausted boy rested his back on a giant rock that protruded from the cliff wall, laying his mechanical arms beside him. "Hoh..."</p>
<p>"I feel kinda guilty." He looked up and saw both approached him, with Matthew talking, "For freeing you from the cycle like that."</p>
<p>"S'fine." And he looked back down.</p>
<p>Folding his arms, "No, but... I just can't stand to see it. You guys, fighting all the time."</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>"You're not really great with strangers... are you, pal?"</p>
<p>"Mmm..." He shook his head.</p>
<p>"D'you wish you could go back to your colony?"</p>
<p>"If I did, I'd have to fight again."</p>
<p>"<em>Mm.</em>" He gave a slight nod.</p>
<p>Looking on the floor, thinking, "We're in... the same boat."</p>
<p>"That so...? Well then, <em>I guess that makes us friends, eh?</em>"</p>
<p>"Friends?" He tilted up his head and saw Matthew knelt down in front of him on one knee, to level with him. "Ahhhh... I wonder... How she is..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Tied to a tree at night. The two City folks standing in between her talked with each other. "Umph..." She grumbled, raised her head as she saw Shulk and Panacea approaching.</p>
<p>"Release her," ordered Shulk. One of the guys immediately took action.</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh? But, Teacher!</strong>"</p>
<p>"She's already been freed from the Flame Clock. And that makes her a friend."</p>
<p>"'Friend'...?" Mumbled Glimmer in distrust, still lingering in her old faction. She stood up after her rope is gone.</p>
<p>"All right, then. I'd like you to answer a few questions for me. May I?" Glimmer puffed out some air. He didn't wait for her, requested, "First we'll need your name, and the colony you belonged to."</p>
<p>"Hmph." And she looked away, refusing to say anything. But Shulk looked down and saw her dog tag attached on her arm. "So your name is 'Glimmer'. Colony Gamma. Assigned to the field support platoon, yes?"</p>
<p>"Argh urgh..." And she quickly covered her dog tag with embarrassment.</p>
<p>"That's far. Gamma's territory is nowhere near here. <em>So what are you doing out here all alone? Tell me who destroyed it.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh!</strong>" And she looked at him, surprised.</p>
<p>"Your colony's Clock, I mean. <strong>That isn't military intel.</strong> Surely you could tell me that, no?"</p>
<p>"...Weirdos. Two of them."</p>
<p>"'Weirdos'...?"</p>
<p>"They waded straight into our battle with Keves, a-a-and then..."</p>
<p>"And the Consuls?" Panacea asked. To which Glimmer shook her head. "Pffff... You're saying they took out Moebius? That not too shabby. Teacher's level."</p>
<p>"What were these two like?"</p>
<p>"One had... silver hair. Blue garb. Cut the Clock clean through with a red sword."</p>
<p>"Right..." He looked down for a while to search through his memory for anyone matching the description, then asked, "And the other?"</p>
<p>"Some guy, <em>didn't seem too bright.</em> Black clothes, used knuckles. He's the one that defeated the Consuls, with the power of some weird light." And she looked down at her hand, remembering that she now had it too.</p>
<p>"Hang on a sec." Someone from behind, big buff guy with tanned skin wearing black clothes approached her at such description. "You're serious about that? That guy. Did his hair... kinda look a bit like this?" He used both his hands to make some shape behind him.</p>
<p>"Urg... Mmm..." Glimmer agreed.</p>
<p>And he got excited, "<strong>It's Matthew. Has to be him. That's mad. So he's still alive!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Matthew, eh?" Shulk asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. He's a guy from the City. W-we were in Procurement together. If someone's been beating up Moebius, I can't think of anyone else but him."</p>
<p>"He's that strong, is he?" Shulk was surprised.</p>
<p>"Mm." The buff guy agreed.</p>
<p>"...You people, you're from the City?" Glimmer asked.</p>
<p>Panacea ordered, "Quiet. Did I say you could ask questions?"</p>
<p>"Mmph."</p>
<p>Shulk: "No, it's all right. You're correct, we do have Citizens among us... but there's a bit more to it. <strong>We</strong>- are- the Liberators. We seek out survivors from the City."</p>
<p>"Survivors?"</p>
<p>"That's right. In order to protect this world..."</p>
<p>"Hmph..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Darkness with faint glimpse of moonlight is where she rested herself. Not far from her, at the corner, was two City folks, standing beside a fire pot{{footnote: A pot put on top of a stick that stuck to the ground, and charcoal and other burnable materials put into the pot and light it on fire, to act as a traditional lamp post before the invention of light bulb.}}, talking to each other, perhaps also watching over her. She pulled her feet and wrapped his arms around them, putting down her head, alone in the cold, damp place. "Huh..."</p>
<p>'Beep beep' "<strong>HUH!!</strong>" Her head bounced up. She immediately activated her iris, saw the status changed to 'Communications online'.</p>
<p>Concurrently, Panacea sat herself at a table with an ether lamp in the middle, surrounded by tents and centered by a campfire, heard 'beep beep beep' while she was looking at something else. "Hm? Comm signals...?" The Comm device she put on the table keeps beeping. She wondered, "<em>Who'd call at this time...?</em> <strong>Oh!</strong>" Then, she jumped up, realized something, "<strong>One of them?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Back to Glimmer, she received new information, reading, 'Colony Eta approaching.' "He's here." So she knows. She made up her choice, stood up, approached the two City folks outside with her weapons drawn, prepared to engage.</p>
<p>After laying the two down, she guiltlessly dashed for the exit. Or perhaps, she was just too overwhelmed with her desires she cannot feel her guilt, if there are any.</p>
<hr />
<p>Nikol, A, and Matthew were far asleep beside the campfire when the ground started vibrating vehemently. The rocking ground woke Matthew up, "<strong>WHOA!!!</strong>" He jumped up from bed and tried to make sense of what's happening, and the source of the vibration, "<strong>W-what the...?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Earthquake?" Nikol stood up, asking. His wore back his mechanical arm, prepared for battle.</p>
<p>"Wrong." A distinguished. "There's some kind of giant entity on the move." Her heightened sense already found its source, signaled, "Over there." And she immediately make a dash for where they were to continue on earlier in the afternoon but was too exhausted to.</p>
<p>"Huh?" No time for them to react; they immediately acted by following behind her.</p>
<p>Arriving at the cliff where the road twisted to either left or right{{footnote: One didn't see, and it's not important anyhow.}}, a giant entity with green-yellow lights on its surface were floating to the far side of the protruding cliff. To reach that protruding cliff, they had to turn right and follow an arc.</p>
<p>"<strong>A Ferronis!</strong>" shouted Matthew. "<strong>This late at night? Which colony is it?</strong>"</p>
<p>A commented, "It's odd. It should have a crew of soldiers but doesn't."</p>
<p>Nikol noted, "Looks like it's heading to the east."</p>
<p>She was triggered, "Huh! <strong>After it, Matthew.</strong>" We're not sure what she sensed, or foresaw, but...</p>
<p>"<strong>YEAH!!!</strong>" And he lead the way on the arc, the rest followed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Even late at night did Shulk not stopped training, practicing his sparring skills, until Panacea interrupted him, dashing in while shouting anxiously, "<strong>We've been had, Teacher!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"The girl. She's snuck off!"</p>
<p>"You're kidding... The watch?"</p>
<p>"She knocked them clean out. Nothing that'll leave a scar."</p>
<p>"Indeed." There's little time to act. He had to decide what to do next now. "Let's find her. She'll likely be heading for a colony. They'll erase her on sight."</p>
<p>"<em>Dammit. More babysitting.</em> Told you we should've given her the full lowdown..."</p>
<p>"<em>I'm sorry...</em> I thought it'd be too much for her to take in. I was hoping to ease her into it... <strong>AHHH!!!</strong>" And then the ground started shaking.</p>
<p>"<strong>Ah! Teacher!</strong>" Panacea tried to fathom what's going on, calling out to her soul anchor.</p>
<p>He raised his tone, "<strong>Well now... This isn't good. Panacea, rouse the others now! READY FOR BATTLE!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"On it!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Glimmer had almost arrive the protruded cliff herself. She ran and ran and ran, not forgetting to look behind her for any signs of pursuers. None, great! Upon arrival, she already say Colony Eta's Ferronis soon halting to a stop in a minute. She stopped and caught her breathe while waiting it to come nearer.  "Made it." That was relieving. Now she could return to her old life. Now she could be rescued. Now her desire, her wishes, would be fulfilled!</p>
<p>Colony Eta's Flame Clock burned ragingly; its flames occupied more than half of the rim. The two blue lights, like the eyes of a ghost, located at its chest, was blinded following the turning on of a white spotlight. So strong and bright was the lamp that it's comparable to that used in football matches or stadium for outdoor night events. The sudden change of illumination wasn't friendly to her; she raised her elbow to cover it while her eyes slowly get used to it. "Ung ah..."</p>
<p>After she got used to the light, she shouted to Eta, "<strong>I... I'm Glimmer, from Colony Gamma! I was a member of the field support platoon! I lost my colony in the fight with Colony 5. I-I've been... reconnoitering solo!</strong>" Then, she signaled behind, "<strong>Beyond here, there's a camp!</strong>" Not that she could continue speaking; Eta already fired a beam at her. The long history of war had trained her subconscious to dodge immediately, but the beam hit the floor with such strength it rolled her into the air, bumped against the floor a few times, rolled along, before halting to a stop. "Urgh..."</p>
<p>"Ung urgh..." She had some time to recover, but the spotlight did not wait for her. Shining on her, she immediately recuperated the strength to get back on her feet, repeating, "I... <strong>I'm telling you... I'm Glimmer... from Gamma! I'm not your enemy! LISTEN TO ME!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>The last sentence she shout, the voice on Eta annoyingly don't bother listening to her, "Oh but you are, pet."</p>
<p>"Huh?" She was so confused, both because of what he said, and because of him not respecting her, speaking while she was speaking.{{footnote: Yeah, because human can't listen when they speak -- multitasking such way is false. When you speak, your brain is thinking and arranging what you're to speak, shutting down the faculty by drawing away almost all the attention that's used to make sense of the sound that arrived at your ears. That's why, when you speak and your hands are doing something, you only speak around 3 words before having to pause, because your brain keeps switching tasks to do 2 things at a time, repeatedly.}}</p>
<p>The Consul teleported on top of a platform on Eta, showing himself, explained, "Soldiers who've lost their Flame Clocks have outlived their purpose."</p>
<p>She can't believed what she'd heard, "My... Lord Consul...!"</p>
<p>"<em>You wanna know why? Because you're no longer good for anything.</em> <strong>Ohhh, beg pardon. You gave me the enemy's lo-ca-tion, didn't ya? Then I suppose</strong> you were good for something... <strong>But your fate</strong> is erasure. <strong>G'NIGHT!!!</strong>"  And another beam prepared to launch at her.</p>
<p>Her hopes shattered. All she'd come for nothing. Her colony, her faction, no longer accept her. Where she put hope, was now her desolation. Step by step, she drooped back, all hope lost. "<strong>Ah...!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>What are you doing?! MOVE!!!</strong>" Shulk had arrived at the scene quick enough, saw she was frozen along the path of the beam, shouted but she would not act, brain-dead. He managed to reach her on time, hugged her, and rolled on the other side with her, just as the beam slashed the ground, leaving a line of burning dirt and grass remnants, emitting black soot, polluting the air.</p>
<p>That's not the Moebius's concern, though. The spotlight changed location again, at the two. Holding over her shoulders, he asked, "Are you OK?" He was looking at the Ferronis, not at her, but he explained while she was looking at him,  "This is what I wanted to protect you from. Now you see, this is the true nature of the Consuls."</p>
<p>"Ngh..." Nothing hurts more than the heart.</p>
<p>He then stood up, withdrew his weapon, the Monado, while Glimmer had some time to recuperate on the floor. Too much for her.</p>
<p>"Who're you...?" asked the cowhead Moebius.</p>
<p>"This wasn't the compact..."</p>
<p>"<strong>'Compact'?</strong>"</p>
<p>"The one with Z. We vowed a ceasefire. Not to interfere until matters were resolved."</p>
<p>"Ah yes. I guess Lord Z did order us not to get involved or some such... But that was before..." and he turned off the spotlight. "<strong>Before two of my comrades were slain without remorse! Now things are personal!</strong>" And he transformed into his Moebius form, emitting vast red-black fog from the surface of his body. He then controlled Eta to started moving, preparing for attack.</p>
<hr />
<p>The three still hadn't arrived at the scene; the arc was too large to cover by legs. As fast as they can, the speed of sound traveled faster. Boom, bash, clash. "They're fighting... <strong>Get ready!</strong>" Not far now. They could already see the lights from the weapons.</p>
<p>"There!" Matthew saw Glimmer behind Shulk and some other City folks. "But what are those other guys all about? Never seen 'em before." He's talking about Shulk.</p>
<p>A seemed to recognize, or maybe not, but that's not for now. "We can talk about it later. We're joining the fray!"</p>
<p>"<strong>HO-HOH!!!</strong> Thought you'd never ask, hah!" And they prepared to battle beside the others that're already battling.</p>
<hr />
<p>Halfway fighting, Shulk had time to ask, glancing over his shoulder, "Who're you guys...?"</p>
<p>Eyes on Eta, Matthew replied, "Sorry, man. Stealin' your show. I'm Matthew, and this is A. Oh, and he's Nikol." Where he signaled, he peered over his shoulder to refer to who he's referring to. "We had a run-in with your friend Glimmer over there. Couldn't just let her split, y'know."</p>
<p>"Wait, so then you're..." He was focusing on A, and A looked back at him. He saw the plus-shaped earring she wore. "Ah!" A nodded back at him, not speaking anything. But he already knew.</p>
<p>The Moebius realized, "So, this is the so-called 'Ouroboros power'? Now I see. So that's how you were able to kill a Moebius, is it?"</p>
<p>"<em>You ain't see nothing yet, bub. How about I give you a demo from up close?</em>"</p>
<p>"That's an awfully mean grimace you're giving me there. I do somethin' to ya? I haven't the faintest idea why you'd be so mad at little old me..."</p>
<p>"<em>Well, maybe you don't... But <strong>I</strong> sure as hell do!</em>" He recalled how the golden mask stabbed his grandad in his chest. "I hate you so much, a <strong>thousand deaths wouldn't bring me peace!</strong>"</p>
<p>Even Glimmer looked up at him. "Ungh..." Both her and Nikol wondered why he felt so angry.</p>
<p>A tried to soothe him, "Matthew. Easy now. Rage blinds you."</p>
<p>"We've been through that one before! Thing is... Anyone who acts all high and mighty like that... <strong>needs a bruisin'!</strong>" And he summoned his Ouroboros power to evaporate off the surface of his body.</p>
<p>"<strong>Wooooowwwwww!!!</strong> Big words! I'd love to see you try. And I've got just the ticket to make it reeeeeaaallll interesting!" And ended with the flick of his finger.</p>
<p>"What now...?" The ground started shaking and another Kevesi Ferronis joined beside Eta, coming from below, hidden in the cloud sea before.</p>
<p>Panacea noted, "It's another Ferronis!"</p>
<p>The Moebius teleported in between the two Ferronises, floated mid-air, and started releasing tremendous power that co-joined both Ferronis from the middle. The side of both Ferronises melt as the 'nerves' made of such black fog power pierced itself into the sides, like the roots of a mangrove tree piercing deep into the ground, while some of its roots floated above ground. Both Ferronis slowly came together, closer and closer, until they attached, using the Moebius as glue.</p>
<p>"What the hell is that?! <strong>Gotta be shittin' me!</strong>" asked Matthew.</p>
<p>"<strong>Hahaha! 'Ey up, have summa this!</strong>" And both Ferronis fired thousands of rays at an angle in front, attacking all grounds. Blocked or dodged the people did. Those who can't, scream and rolled. That included Glimmer, whom tried to get on her feet after rolling a distance. "Heheh... <strong>Well, kids? How'd you like them apples? I put two Ferronises together to double my power. How's about that for a bloody breakthrough?!</strong>" He didn't wait for them to stand on their feet, announced, "<strong>Righto... This time round...</strong>" and he scanned for his next target, and found Glimmer, "<strong>Let's <em>concentrate</em>!</strong>" And both of the cannons targeted her. It'll take some time to gather the energy.</p>
<p>Matthew noticed, "On Glimmer?"</p>
<p>Nikol already took action, dashed at her, "<strong>Careful!</strong>" He stood in front of her and wrapped his mechanical arms around to shield the incoming beam. Bright light blinded the others, concealing their life and death status. The intensity gradually reduced, where Glimmer realized she's still alive.</p>
<p>"Hoh!" She looked up, and indeed, she saw the boy. But his hands wouldn't have chance against the intense beam. Someone huge standing in front of him was the real culprit to the scene.</p>
<p>"I like your attitude, kiddo." It was the guy standing beside Shulk when they were fighting Alvis long time ago.</p>
<p>"Huh?" He lowered his mechanical arm a bit to see who he was.</p>
<p>"Leave it to Uncle Rex." He twisted his sword and broke the beam, shining another bright light at others watching. The bright turquoise green of his sword against the dark night revealed, and "I'll show 'em a thing or three!"</p>

<p>Blue sky, white clouds. Inside the City. Between the buildings is a square paved with green grass and walkways that criss-crossed on all sides, making an octagon tiled path in the middle. People were gathering there, looking after their children playing and chatting with each other. On one balcony overlooking the square, Matthew and Na'el stood, smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>"15 years ago feels like a dream now. Like it was an eternity away..." Matthew drew out his knuckles thereafter. Na'el saw it, commented, "You might never have to use those again."</p>
<p>"Now wouldn't that be amazing? The Queen of Keves though... She's still not free."</p>
<p>"What, you think our fight's still not over?" And she looked back at the running children and tranquil parents, asked, "Can't things stay like this?"</p>
<p>"The soldiers, they're still fighting. Right this moment."</p>
<p>Na'el engaged deeply in what he'd said, then shared, "Personally, if things could just stay this way... I'd be happy."</p>
<p>"<strong>You serious?</strong> If Grandad could hear you, he'd lay you out flat." He teased, but she wasn't smiling. There below was the girl from before that led a group of people and found her, dragged her away to play the piano, playing with other friends.</p>
<p>"Yeeaahhh, I know what he'd say. 'The soldiers are the roots from which we grew.'" She imitated the voice of her Grandad. "But still... we are who we are, right? And them and the Moebius, they're a whole different story. No reason we can't coexist..."</p>
<p>He immediately snuffed her out, "Nah, don't gimme that. Come on!" Their parents, died 15 years ago; that's not something he can forget.</p>
<p>"There's no need to fight if we just stay out of each other's way. It's worked out fine for the <em>past 15 years.</em> I guess, for you... <em>it's all or nothing</em>, huh?" She wasn't even looking at him; perhaps she don't want to look into his eyes, don't want him to look into her eyes.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Those children are <strong>everything</strong> to me, you know... What choice have I got?" She pulled her her sleeve and look at the band-lace made of strings tied around her wrist. What do they signify? Who does it remind her of? What story lies behind it? We don't yet know.</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<hr />
<p>"Leave it to Uncle Rex. I'll show 'em a thing or three!" Now, everyone was just, 'whoaaaaa'...</p>
<p>Matthew remembered someone else previously in danger, dashed towards Nikol, asked, "You OK?"</p>
<p>"Y-yeah..."</p>
<p>"Can you stand?" She immediately got up on her feet. Then, he turned his attention back at the Moebius, asked, "Nikol, ready to fight?"</p>
<p>"Urh!" And he nodded.</p>
<p>"<strong>You too, Glim! Hup-hup!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>HUUUUHHH???</strong>" After what she did?</p>
<p>"<strong>There'll be time for</strong> thinking later. <strong>For now... it's down to brass tacks!</strong>"</p>
<p>Now she felt guilty for her stupidity. So she'll end her stupidity by fighting alongside them, drew her weapons.</p>
<p>Uncle Rex peered over his shoulder and noted their interactions, without displaying any specific emotions. One of his eyes, his left ones, was permanently damaged. He split his sword from single to dual -- one red, blaring with greenish-yellow flames as its blade; the other dark yellow, with bright yellow-green flaming blades. Round 2!</p>
<hr />
<p>More and more lives get sucked from both Ferronises's Flame Clock into the Moebius's mouth. Rex dragged backwards as "<em>I get it.</em> So that's his game, <em>is it?</em> I'll take the one on the left! <strong>Shulk, you take the right!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Sure thing."</p>
<p>"And as for you!" He looked at Matthew, "kiddo!"</p>
<p>That poked his sensitive spot, "Eh? <strong>Oi who you calling 'kiddo'?</strong>"</p>
<p>"You take out the Moebius! <strong>All in sync!</strong>" Not that he's gonna explain.</p>
<p>"Whuh? In sync?!"</p>
<p>"Let's go!" And they already dashed off while Matthew still had questions,</p>
<p>"<strong>HEY!! The hell!</strong>" Rex and a green-haired girl whom wielded a staff ran to the left. She launched a light ball at the Ferronis, hit it, while Rex took the advantage and jumped onto the Ferronis, dashing along the metal frames up to its top.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shulk and Panacea dodged an attack from the right's Ferronis. "<strong>YAAAAAAAHHHHH!!</strong>" With such high-pitched shouts, she punched her spear into the hull of the Ferronis, breaking its surface, which released sparks and purple electricity. Shulk dashed past her on the arch towards the top.</p>
<p>"Tch..." Matthew had no choice but to follow. "I better hop to it then!" And he and A dashed towards the Moebius.</p>
<p>"Hah! <strong>You're getting on my nerves! Piss off!</strong>" The Moebius, his whole body like cancer cells joining both Ferronis, where only his head isn't concealed by the various nerves and veins, shouted, and launched two beam at Matthew and A, whom dodged agilely. Those that cannot, she slashed past them, he punched through them. Nearing him, he jumped high into the air, called on the power of the Ouroboros, and punched at his core. Simultaneously, Rex and Shulk sliced through the Flame Clocks. Out spit the lives, and shattered his Moebius core, and the three returned to the floor. Did they succeed?</p>
<p>"My... <strong>my Ferronises...</strong>" He cannot even disengage with his core leaking dark energy. "<strong>My pretties... My fused friends! ALL MY WORK RUINED!!!</strong>" And bright light emitted from the combined entity, and soon it exploded, the fireball engulfing the cliff edges. The shockwave so strong it blurred the surrounding with dusts.</p>
<hr />
<p>Flames, flames, flames. Debris everywhere. Their platform actually didn't collapsed; missed by a little -- it's radius carved a hole just below where they now stand. "Phew... He gave us a hard time." Rex peered down into the cloud sea.</p>
<p>"Nice timing there, Rex." Shulk walked up to him. "Thanks for that."</p>
<p>"Everyone knows the real hero steps up in the third act!"</p>
<p>"Hah!" But he was relieved. "Still, something's off here."</p>
<p>"Mm. Double the Flame Clock..." They recalled. "But no soldiers in sight."</p>
<p>"There has to be more to it, Boss." The glasses-wearing green-haired girl that accompanied Rex mentioned. She had a rectangular crystal on her chest.</p>
<p>Shulk got into a thinking stance, fingers on his chin, shared, "I've heard a rumor... About how one of the Moebius like to create all kinds of experimental Flame Clocks.{{footnote: If you'd watched Xenoblade 3, you'd know who he is.}}"</p>
<p>"Linka, mind looking into that for me?" asked Rex to the green-haired girl.</p>
<p>"I can do that. I'll dispatch a platoon, we'll see if they can get a handle on it."</p>
<p>"Lovely." Then, he turned his attention to their new friend's direction, now that they have the attention to handle them, "Arright, so? Who's this then?"</p>
<p>Shulk walked up beside him, looking at Matthew and A, commented, "City refugee, it seems."</p>
<p>"Well. That explains the Ouroboros power." That's Matthew. Then, he turned to Nikol. Seeing he's in spotlight, his hands that's by his waist unnaturally put down. He asked, "And this soldier? Who released him?"</p>
<p>Shulk eyes was targeted on A. More exactly, her earring. Rex followed glance, realized. "Huh! My day keeps getting better. To business. Tell <em>me, Shulk</em>... How'd Moebius <em>get the jump on you?</em>"</p>
<p>"'Cause of her." He hadn't said anything, but the one who'd hated so much already spoke. Panacea gave a nod in Glimmer's direction.</p>
<p>"Ah urg..."</p>
<p>"We'd meant to protect her, but she went and gave away our position."</p>
<p>"Uh-!" She said nothing. That was the truth, anyways.</p>
<p>Rex eyes was on her for long, then suddenly he realized something, shaky with his breathe, "H-Hang on..." This girl... she looks like... looks like someone... someone long gone from memories... and his smile gone. He took steps toward her, whom still had her heads down. She looked up as he loomed over her, spoken, "You wanted to get back to your friends, huh?"</p>
<p>"Urh..." She looked away.</p>
<p>"Even if it meant getting us all killed." The sternness in his tone grew.</p>
<p>"Urg... <strong>No!</strong>"</p>
<p>He didn't let her speak more, "Don't try to play the innocent with me."</p>
<p>"Hoh..."</p>
<p>"You were <em>well aware of the consequences. But you decided to <strong>ignore</strong> that inconvenient fact.</em>" The others watched as he lectured her, not joining in. Glimmer clenched her fist.</p>
<p>"Enough... <strong>Stop.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Hmm?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>I AM <em>NOT</em> LETTING THE ENEMY GET INTO MY HEAD!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>MANNERS...!!!</strong>" Panacea wanted to interfere, but Shulk held her back. She looked at him, surprised.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the center, Panacea's words flew past her without effects, "<strong>I DIDN'T ASK FOR ANY OF THIS!!! It was almost time for MY Homecoming! My comrades and I... We made it ALLLL this way... I fought... SO SNUFFING HARD... Ungh... Ung huh huh huh huh, ungh...</strong>" Rex was looking at her term symbol.</p>
<p>Nikol looked at her, frozen, releasing a deep breath. "Mhhhh..." He was one that could relate, and who said he isn't her his Homecoming?</p>
<p>Rex didn't let her cry long, spoke calmly. "Listen. <strong>Two</strong> things. First of all, that <em>there</em> was your enemy." He looked behind where they previously fought. The red particles was still floating in the darkness. The flames of the debris were still burning. "And <strong>second</strong>... Let it go. Your friends are gone." And he just walked away thereafter, leaving Nikol looking after her.</p>
<p>"Urg... Uhm..." He was too shy to move forward to comfort her.</p>
<p>"Ermmm, soooo...." Matthew finished watching the event, turned to Shulk, asked as he approached him, "What's the plan from here, then? It's pretty clear you're not our enemies from the way stuff's panning out, but... It's all a bit, <strong>'ehh'</strong>, right?" He referred to A.</p>
<p>Haven't got time to reply, the buff guy whom first realized who's he when Glimmer gave the description started speaking, and others turned to him their attention, "Don't gimme that! Obviously we're teaming up, eh Matty?" He started walking in between the soldiers.</p>
<p>"<strong>DILLON!!! MATE!!! YOU WERE ALIVE?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Ahahaha!</strong> That was about my reaction too. Glad <em>you're still with us, Matt.</em>"</p>
<p>Shulk then approached the reunited two, did a favor, "I'll set us up some tents. We can all debrief each other there."</p>
<p>"Ohhh, now we're talking. Haven't slept under shelter for <strong>yonks.</strong>"</p>
<p>"First light, we'll make a start for our base. If it's all right with you, I'd feel a lot safer if we traveled together."</p>
<p>"I don't really mind... whatcha think?" He asked for A's opinion. She nodded back. Then, he turned to Nikol.</p>
<p>"Mhm..."</p>
<p>And Glimmer? She's still looking away.</p>
<p>"...Awrite{{footnote: Alright}} then."</p>
<p>"Great to hear."</p>
<p>"So, what's this base thing?" He asked as Dillon and Shulk were walking away, "And who are you guys? Feeling kinda lost here..."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you all about it on the way. It's not like we're in any rush."</p>
<p>"Right... Yeah, I suppose that's true." A had already walked past him. "Fine then."</p>
<p>"Great." A walked past Shulk a little. Tent was just up ahead. The fire torch at the distance beside the cave entrance we can still see.</p>
<hr />
<p>During the way back, Matthew asked, "So about these Liberators. What do you guys even do?"</p>
<p>"The Liberators are a resistance faction that Rex and I founded to fight back against Moebius."</p>
<p>"So you've been fighting 'em too!"</p>
<p>"Yeah! Our goal is to free the world, to return it to how it's supposed to be. But right now, we have another immediate objective."</p>
<p>"What's that, then?"</p>
<p>"There are many people, ones from the City like you and Dillon, all soldiers freed from the Clocks. We rescue them, keep them from harm. Working towards that is currently the Liberator's primary concern."</p>
<p>"Hmm..." That's A.</p>
<p>"At its founding, we only had a scant few members in addition Rex and myself. But in time, the people we helped offered us their help in return. And our numbers have swelled considerably. Oh, but... you'll see soon enough. There's our temporary camp now." They were walking through the camp entrance as he finished speaking.</p>
<hr />
<p>Rex were already seen speaking to someone by the table where Panacea sat yesterday, probably. Though, there's now a tent roofing over the table. Rex continued talking to the person after eyeing who'd arrived. Shulk turned around and welcomed them, "Well, we made it. We should be safe here for the time being." Then he signaled to his 5 o'clock, "You can use that tent over there. We've had it set up especially for you."</p>
<p>A appreciated, "Thank you. We'll do just that."</p>
<p>"Phew! Be a nice change to finally get to kip under a roof."</p>
<p>Glimmer's voice was still shaking, "<em>Huh...</em>"</p>
<p>"Mmm..."</p>
<p>Rex had already finished speaking to the person and joined them, shook his head, and commented to Glimmer especially (but also to Nikol), "Look, everyone here knows what's what. Nobody's gonna bully you or anything."</p>
<p>She unbelievably replied, "Gee, thanks, very reassuring... <em>Not.</em>"</p>
<p>Matthew called out loud, "<strong>All right, break it up now! How about</strong> we grab a bite and unwind, eh? Don't need you running around hangry."</p>
<p>She immediately rebutted, "I'm not really hungry." 'Groooggg...' Her stomach refused to side with her as she finished her sentence, in strike. She shook her head, "Urgggg..."</p>
<p>Shulk suggested, "Try to get some rest. We'll take the guard shifts."</p>
<p>Panacea updated them, "We'll be departing for base in the morning; Don't go the whole night without sleep."</p>
<p>"Noted. All right then, we'll see you later." Shulk replied, then with Rex took off, followed by Panacea and Linka.</p>
<hr />
<p>He stood cross-arm by himself under a tree, back lying on the trunk. Someone interrupted his thoughts, "That was harsh, Boss."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"You didn't have to talk to her like that. Not cool."</p>
<p>"Tell me something I don't know."</p>
<p>"Hrrrrh... You don't want her with us, is that it? I'm sure she'd see sense if you just gave her a chance. What's the problem?"</p>
<p>"Mm."</p>
<p>"Is it because... it feels too close to home?"</p>
<p>"D'you always have to be right on the mark? Very well spotted though, Linka."</p>
<p>"I knew it the moment I saw her. She looks like them... exactly."</p>
<p>"I know, right? Someday, I knew it'd happen, but... Not exactly the best timing, is it...?"</p>
<p>"It's the same deal with him, y'know." She turned to look at the camp's direction.</p>
<p>"What, Shulk? Really?"</p>
<p>"Really really. Panacea said she had a hunch."</p>
<p>"<em>Strike me...</em> Hmph..." Heavy on the heart. He pinched the little moustache he had, grooming, as he continued, "I guess we're bound by fate. Like it was meant to be..." Perhaps the stars and the moon and the clouds that blanketed them had more to say?{{footnote: This is in the 2nd video; the 1st would have bright sun, which didn't sound like correct timing.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>Nikol was cranking his mechanical arms with various tools on the table under the tent himself when Shulk sounded from beside, "Nice gear you've got."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ungh!</strong>" He turned and saw him, but not the green Nopon with standing hair{{footnote: If you'd watched Xenoblade 3, you'd know who's he. Read on to be introduced to his name once again here, by Shulk to Nikol.}} that was too low from registering in his field of sight.</p>
<p>Shulk continued, "The joints move without a hitch, <em>and</em> listen to the purr of that motor!"</p>
<p>He was humble, "I-It's just a tool for destruction. Death. Nothing... to be praised."</p>
<p>"Good point." And he took a seat beside him.</p>
<p>"Umm..."</p>
<p>"Whoa...! That's an Equites pulse driver assembly! No wonder it's so pleasing to the ear! And melded with a cylinder...?" He continued to stay surprised with his mechanical skills. He even touched and feel the surface. "Perfect soldering technique!" Nikol was flabbergasted by someone speaking mechanics with him.</p>
<p>"Hey... Stop that..."</p>
<p>"Did you make it yourself?"</p>
<p>"Uh... Yeah...? Well..." And he put his hands back to the machine, his heart wasn't there, or too shy to be there.</p>
<p>"I've always liked tinkering with machines, as well. I can't help myself."</p>
<p>"Uhm..."</p>
<p>"Earlier..."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"You tried to help us, right?" That's when trying to shield Glimmer from the blast, "Using this."</p>
<p>"Uhm..."</p>
<p>"A tool is merely a tool. It does as the user chooses." He moved his prosthetic right arm, putting his other hand over it as if it was heavy to hold. "Wouldn't you agree?"</p>
<p>"Urgh..."</p>
<p>"Be it to kill others, or... to help them..." He looked down and just saw.</p>
<p>"Your arm..."</p>
<p>He took it up and showed it to him, "A war wound. From way back when. Then Riku here made me this one, but..."</p>
<p>The green Nopon heard the triggering word and immediately rebutted, "<strong>'But'</strong>... what, please? Manner of expression seem pointed."</p>
<p>"I'm not saying it's bad! It's not bad at all. Just a little squeaky." When he moved his arms, the moving of the gears at the joints can be heard clearly.</p>
<p>"That same as saying, 'bad'. <strong>Riku</strong> had to make from <strong>hodgepodge material. Do not nitpick.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Mm hmm..." Nikol was watching their interactions, before asking, "Hey, um... Would you mind if I... take a look?"</p>
<p>He put his mechanical arm on the table. After some observations, Nikol confirmed his hypothesis, "Thought so." Pointing at some parts, "Here, you're missing a shim between these bits. That'll be why it creaks. Hang on, I... should have one here... some-where..." and he went to search in his toolbox. All the while Shulk's eyes was on him, not on his mechanical arm. It reminded of eons ago when he was the one in the lab working out with parts. Then, he looked at Riku, whom was smiling back at him. Seemingly they staged the scene, and Riku did it on purpose, helped them reunited their precious time together. Some conversation openers they were.</p>
<hr />
<p>Glimmer was looking at the Agnus Castle{{footnote: Why do one know, because it inherits the description from Xenoblade 3, and one made such assumption that you'd already know how an Agnus Castle looked like. Nevertheless, one added the description here once more.}} in the far distance, blurred by dust particles, which looked like some pointed teeth going up and down{{footnote: So, imagine you put your bottom jaw on top of your top jaw, so your top jaw's teeth faced down, and your bottom jaw's teeth face up.}}, by herself. The wind brushed over the surface of the grass and the flowers. No one interrupted her to keep herself thinking and sorting out things.</p>
<p>Nikol approached her after a while, stopped at some distance away, "<em>Urm...</em>" He then walked closer to her.</p>
<p>Already sensed his existence, she asked in annoyance, "What? I won't run away again. Not if there's anywhere left <em>to</em> run."</p>
<p>"I uh... I think it was good... what happened."</p>
<p>"Huh?" She turned to look at him, curious what he meant by that.</p>
<p>"Fighting against you."</p>
<p>"I don't understand."</p>
<p>"If we hadn't fought... we wouldn't be here now, like this."</p>
<p>She looked away, "'Here', isn't exactly a sparking picnic." Where he hates fighting, she only wanted Homecoming before this, and probably still lingering inside her.</p>
<p>He took a seat beside her. "People... would bully me..."</p>
<p>"Wha?" She turned and look at him. That's unusual for the only person whom survived a battle, all comrades dead except for.</p>
<p>"'Cause... I can't summon a Blade. Makes me... kinda useless."</p>
<p>"Hmph..." She turned her head away, as if she also agreed.</p>
<p>"But all those bullies... they're dead now."</p>
<p>"Yeah? Well, good for you. But that's a weight off y-"</p>
<p>She hadn't finished her sentence when he continued his story, exclaimed, "Someone like me... How'd I survive?... <em>Nobody else did...</em>"</p>
<p>"Ur urgh... hmm..." Not that she could rebut.</p>
<p>"But now, I-I can make something of myself. That's how it feels. <em>Honestly,</em> just knowing who I'm meant to be fighting... That's the biggest thing of all."</p>
<p>"Nikol..."</p>
<p>"Another thing... I'm happy about."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"Back then... I'm glad I didn't have to kill you."</p>
<p>She wouldn't give up her domination in fighting skills, "<strong>You</strong> got to be joking. A little squirt like you could never take <em>me</em> down."</p>
<p>"Umph." He was just smiling at her when she denied. She turned back to look at him, and he continued, "That day... we became friends."</p>
<p>"Ur! Urg..." Her eyes widened, then looked to the bottom left of her eye. Can't deny. Turning her head away, she acknowledged, "You're an idiot. <em>Wow.</em>" The sun hadn't rose yet, but that scene is what they'll enjoy.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the morning, sun rose so high in the sky, Nikol were already talking to A, and Glimmer stood beside him, looking at some other direction, when the one whom always woke up late came to them, "Oi-oi! Lovely morning today! Perfect weather."</p>
<p>"Wrong. This cloud cover practically guarantees rain." That's A lecturing him on what weather forecast means. Everyone was just looking at the heavy clouds for a while until Nikol broke the ice,</p>
<p>"Morning... everyone..."</p>
<p>"Hello..." Still looking away, she reluctantly spoke out.</p>
<p>"<strong>WHOA!!! Did I just hear a 'hello' from you?!</strong>" Matthew just had his ears cleared, continued teasing, "<strong>What next</strong>, a rain of Brogs?"</p>
<p>"Plain rain's bad enough." argued A.</p>
<p>"Damn, if I didn't know better. I'd think you were warming up to me."</p>
<p>"Umph... <em>I was forgetting the <strong>real</strong> idiot among us.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Theeerreeee you go! It's cool. This is progress!</strong>" He explained to A, not being invoked by her words.</p>
<p>"Tsk."</p>
<hr />
<p>The sun went higher up, and other soldiers had already getting up one by one, talking or just getting ready. Shulk and the other three joined in, "Morning, all! Feeling- refreshed, and, ready to take on the world?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeaaahhh</strong>, thanks to you guys. Haven't slept this well in <strong>a-ges</strong>."</p>
<p>Rex: "Don't mention it. It's gonna be quite a trek to our base, though."</p>
<p>"Yeah, speaking of, where is this base of yours exactly?"</p>
<p>That leave Panacea to explained, looking towards a vine-covered cliff, allowing for climbing. "Once we climb that cliff and follow the road, you'll be able to see for yourself."</p>
<p>Matthew: "<strong>Huh, sweet! Can't wait to see what it's like.</strong> How 'bout you, Glimmer?"</p>
<p>She's not even looking at him, speaking from behind dull-ly, "Not interested."</p>
<p>"Aaaaa-ha-hah, <strong>still being a sulk, eh?</strong>"</p>
<p>Nikol broke in to save the situation for her, "I-I'm... a little curious, I think."</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah, attaboy, Nikol! See that</strong>, Glimmer? You could stand to learn from this one."</p>
<p>"Can someone shut this guy up?" She was already so annoyed by his mouth.</p>
<p>The one whom traveled with him for so long had already felt the annoyance for not sure how long, years? "He'll grow on you."</p>
<p>Shulk continued their original conversations, "We have some refugees from the City, by the way, back at base. You should let them know you're fine once we've arrived. I'm sure they'll appreciate it."</p>
<p>The only new City refugee{{footnote: A wasn't a City refugee, by the way, you'd know later.}} replied, "Yeah, I'll be sure to do that, thanks."</p>
<p>Rex summed it up, "<strong>All right, we all done with the banter? This road's not gonna walk itself.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Yeah, let's make tracks!"</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-3"><a class="header" href="#footnotes-3">Footnotes:</a></h3>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="on-their-way-home"><a class="header" href="#on-their-way-home">On Their Way Home</a></h1>
<p>The group trod the road, hamburgered by two levnises, one in the front, one at the back.{{footnote: It's a wonder how they climb rocks, but one assumed they can jump or even glide/fly short distance, given the jet-engine like object attached to their back which one guessed is jet engines.}} The ground was green; and there seemed to be a turn in front.{{footnote: Though, in the evening sky, you can't see well.}} To the left where they currently walked were tall cliffs, and to the right, a cliff to fall off the ledge; but soon they'll enter a region where both side are cliffs. Matthew was walking behind Dillon, looking at his figure, but his thoughts drifted afar.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back at the City, nice blue day with some clouds. Perhaps it was memories, the scene wasn't so bright and clear. Matthew and Dillon spoke with each other, Na'el accompanied the former, and Grandpa watching over them, just outside the City. Other folks were forming their own little circles here and there, conversing. Children may participate, shouting or speaking, but they may adrift, not too interested in adult conversations, like the girl whom always tried to find Na'el to play her piano.</p>
<p>Too bored of their parents talk, she searched her surrounding until she found her. Immediately she shouted, "<strong>Na'el!</strong>" as her face brightened from dull, and she already ran off towards her. Na'el heard her shouts, turned towards her. Her parents might have wanted to put brakes on her but was too slow to react. Na'el knelt down and she jumped into her hugs. Matthew turned and saw the scenery.</p>
<p>"Mm, you smell nice. Guess I won't see you for a while..."</p>
<p>"Come and visit!"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I will I promise."</p>
<p>"I wanna hear you play again!"</p>
<p>"Without a piano? Tricky..."</p>
<p>"Then bring one with you!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Uhh...</strong>" As if that can be easily brought; not like it's an electrical ones, but with chord and strings. Actually, the other groups stopped talking and just looked at the interaction, weirdly. One of them represented the others and walked towards Matthew and the others, said,</p>
<p>"We'll all miss you guys. It's been a long time coming. Place is full up."</p>
<p>Matthew took over the conversation, "Don't forget to call us, soon as you arrive."</p>
<p>"Yeah. A second City... We'll make it greater than you can ever imagine."</p>
<p>"Them's fighting words."</p>
<p>"Huh, hahaha!" There was silence between them, but their eyes transferred more emotions than can be put into language. After a while, Matthew held out his fist, and he punched back.</p>
<p>Later on, Na'el, Matthew, Dillon, and some others that chose to left behind watched as they left. The child, being the last, turned around and shouted, "<strong>Na'el! Remember your promise!</strong>" She waved as she did so. Her parents waited for her while others walked on.</p>
<p>Na'el, with some thin sadness in her, waved back. Matthew watched her; she dropped her hands. The girl slumped forward, and walked off talking to her parents, not knowing where the future lies.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Ungh..."</p>
<p>"Hmph..." A, walking to his 10 o'clock, sensed something deep in him, perhaps she always sensed so.</p>
<hr />
<p>The guys walked over a bridge paved with lush green. The town had a waterfall near it, and its buildings were overgrown. Two soldiers took watch at the bridge. The levnises accompanying them were nowhere to be seen{{footnote: Actually, the left themselves guarding the beginning side of the bridge.}}; only the people entered the town. Stopped and scanned, Matthew may have been a little disappointed, neutrally commented, "This it...?"</p>
<p>Shulk and the others turned around, himself acknowledged, "Yes. The Liberators' base of operations. All the City survivors we find, we keep safe here."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> People and Nopons sitting around chairs laid on a table, talking to each other. Seemingly this is a canteen. There are tents around where it laid. Bazaars opened their service for anyone wanting to buy goods. Levnises parked themselves at their respective parking lots. There was a tall tower-like structure, climbed by vines, joined on 4 sides by bridges of various climbing angle, to a platform below the tall structure. The platform was guarded by levnises. Further away was some structures that may be part of the tower structure, or may be independent ones. There was a pond below it, probably water from the waterfall earlier. We could see the Great Sword{{footnote: One assumed you already know the Great Sword from Xenoblade 3 and/or Xenoblade 1.}} that pierced into the land from afar. This, is <strong>Colony 9</strong>, in Yesterdale.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>"Well then, once again, welcome. To our headquarters... To Colony 9."</p>
<p>"Uh? Colony 9? Like the one from Keves?" Glimmer was surprised by its name.</p>
<p>Panacea rebutted, "No, <em>not that one</em>. This is the <strong>original</strong> Colony 9. Though I guess that won't mean anything to you, one way or another."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Nikol was more confused than ever.</p>
<p>"I-I don't get it." announced Glimmer.</p>
<p>"Well, anyway! Point is, it's <strong>not- like</strong> a Kevesi or Agnian colony. That's all you need to know right now."</p>
<p>"Uhhh... OK..." Nikol felt.</p>
<p>Linka announced, "I'll go on ahead to the command center and have your quarters prepared. If you'll excuse me..." And she immediately leave.</p>
<p>Dillon also was about to leave, "Right, see you around then, Matthew. Let's have a proper catch-up once things have settled down a bit."</p>
<p>"<strong>Will do, cheers!</strong>" And he did the Chinese welcoming/farewell stance.</p>
<p>Rex looked to Shulk, said, "Righto, let's see how the gang's doing. We can give you a little tour along the way."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's a good idea!" agreed Shulk. "Panacea, can I ask you to take point?"</p>
<p>She agreed, then shouted to the newcomers, "<strong>Right, you heard the man. Try to keep up!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Walking immediately past the tall buildings on both side of the main road, we saw the bazaar and the canteen at the 'square', which is really a roundabout with other structures surrounding the roundabout. Panacea introduced, "The plaza's kind of the heart of Colony 9. Anything you're looking for, you can more or less find it here, be it extra supplies or a quick bite to eat."</p>
<p>Matthew was excited, "<strong>Wow, it's pretty bustlin'.</strong> Reminds me of the City."</p>
<p>Shulk asked, "Well then, would you like to take a little look around?"</p>
<p>"Is- that OK?" questioned Nikol.</p>
<p>Rex replied, "We're not in a hurry or anything. You go and have your stroll."</p>
<p>Panacea: "I'll be waiting for you over there, past the plaza. Speak to me when you're done browsing." That's the other exit of the roundabout -- it only have 2 exits.</p>
<p>"Aight then, don't mind if we do. Let's go have a shufti, guys."</p>
<hr />
<p>Later, they met Panacea, whom asked, "You all done then?"</p>
<p>"Sure. Sorry you had to wait."</p>
<p>"OK. Then let's move swiftly on. Follow me."</p>
<hr />
<p>As they continued walking, Matthew commented, "The City folks I saw actually look pretty happy to be here, huh. It's good to see."</p>
<p>"They're our fellow Liberators now, after all. It's only natural we'd support one another." added Shulk.</p>
<p>"Ah, well... Thanks for that. I mean it, thank you."</p>
<p>"<strong>Eh,</strong> having more helping hands is pretty welcome from our side too." Rex complimented.</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm seeing these tents all over the place. You've got some proper buildings here. Wouldn't it make more sense to live <strong>inside</strong> those?"</p>
<p>Panacea explained, "You'd think, but they're falling apart inside. We've got a policy to avoid living somewhere that might cave in on you." Surely, the trees and punched their roots through the concrete walls; they don't look really safe to one.</p>
<p>"Hmm... Still, feels like a waste."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ohhh!</strong> That contraption!" exclaimed Nikol.</p>
<p>"It's a gem crafting furnace. Pretty antique one." Panacea explained. It was 1.5x the height of an average human, shaped like a thermometer where you can insert the gems at the bottom 'fat' part, and tweak the knobs to the side on the stem as it boils up, and the output will be one don't know where.</p>
<p>Rex: "It's been out of commission for <strong>a-ges</strong>. At this point it's pretty much just scrap."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see..." Nikol commented.</p>
<p>"<strong>Right</strong>, this is where I leave you." said Panacea. They'd arrived at the Command Center. Tables were laid, looking like receptions. Behind the command center was an opening with some balcony overlooking the waterfall. Tables and other objects were laid around, people talking to each other. "This is the command center. It's... where the cap-tains convene, where we plan our strategies and manage affairs. The <strong>nerve</strong> center of the Liberators, you could say."</p>
<p>"Well met, everyone." Linka rejoined the group. "I'm happy to inform you that quarters have been arranged for Matthew and his associates."</p>
<p>Rex: "Great, cheers for that!"</p>
<p>"Allow me to show you the way."</p>
<p>Matthew: "Thanks, that'd be great." They walked out of the command center and head towards the direction of the tower-like structure. By the beginning of the bridge, to its side was a place where soil were tilled and planted. Kevesi and Agnians were working there.</p>
<p>"What? Never seen a field?" asked Panacea.</p>
<p>"No." Matthew continued, "Those guys... They're Kevesi and Agnian soldiers, aren't they?"</p>
<p>"They were. Teacher, and the others freed them." And Matthew was taken aback in memories.</p>
<hr />
<p>Where a rainbow casted over a waterfall, and a machine hidden below the rocks, Na'el and Matthew lead some City folks towards the pond. There was a monster imitating as a giant flower, hiding its body underwater; such flower was attached to its back.</p>
<p>They walked behind the waterfall, and Matthew noticed something, "<em>Whoa...</em>" Boxes of resources were laid there; but what interested were the bundle of corpse laid randomly on the floor, all dead. Creatures with a torch attached to their tail crawl around, perhaps to eat their remains, perhaps they just roam. Skittles (flying bugs) occupy some of the air field. "<em>What in the...?</em> Doesn't look like they died in combat... All the husks around here are whip-thin." The corpses looked Kevesi from their signature armor.</p>
<p>"You think they starved...?" asked one of the female City folk wearing goggles.</p>
<p>"<em>Maybe.</em>"</p>
<p>"With this much wildlife around, though?"</p>
<p>"Most things around these parts are poisonous. Not really edible."</p>
<p>"Well... there's Castle supplies. Don't they get those?" asked another low-tone male City folk.</p>
<p>"You think they got raided, maybe?" hypothesized Na'el.</p>
<p>"Doubt it. Enemies woulda mopped 'em up. No sign of Blade wounds."</p>
<p>"Hmmm..."</p>
<p>"For whatever reason, intentional or not... These people... were abandoned."</p>
<p>"Local fauna aside... with this much fresh water, they could have easily farmed. There's so many ways they could've kept themselves alive...!"</p>
<p>The male City folk reminded her, "<em>Thing is, though, fighting's all these guys know.</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but..."</p>
<p>"You know they're not like us. Nobody taught them what could be..."</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<hr />
<p>As memories dimmed and faded, attention returned to the present. Linka explained, "It's not as simple as: plant some seeds, wait for the harvest. We're teaching them the ins and outs, as you can see. We're showing them there's more to life than battle."</p>
<p>"<em>You didn't do this in the City?</em>" asked Panacea.</p>
<p>"No... We did do that stuff. We did, but..."</p>
<p>"Hm?" Panacea and Linka were curious for so short a time that immediately after, they turned and walked away with Rex and Shulk. And they followed on. Matthew took one last look at the tilling groups as the others passed through him, his minds in Na'el's desperate shouts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Then show me already! This world of peace, where nobody has to die... Make it come true!</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He shook off such thoughts and continued their tour. The turned around the corner instead of crossing the bridge towards the tower-like structure, into some alleyway that leads to tents with a campfire in the middle.</p>
<hr />
<p>"The tents we set up for you are further up along this road." said Panacea. "So thoughts, and questions?"</p>
<p>Matthew: "I'm liking the atmosphere. Just right for settling down."</p>
<p>Nikol: "There're... so many people, and it's so busy. It's worlds different from our colonies."</p>
<p>Glimmer: "For now, anyways, we'll be glad of your hospitality. Is that right?"</p>
<p>They arrived near the campfire, where Linka announced, "And these will be your tents. Feel free to use all the facilities here at your leisure."</p>
<p>Matthew: "We'll make the most of it. Thanks, for everything."</p>
<p>"It's all right. All in a day's work."</p>
<p>"All right then... It's a bit early to turn in still, so what say we have a little nose around?"</p>
<p>"Ah, that reminds me." said Shulk, whom was tailing them. "Riku said he had some business with you. Would you mind stopping by his place later?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Who's Riku, again?"</p>
<p>Nikol: "Oh, right... You've not met him yet, Matthew."</p>
<p>Shulk explained, "He's a Nopon mechanic working with us Liberators. Quite a skilled one, at that."</p>
<p>"Huh, if you say so. So, where's he at?"</p>
<p>"There's an abandoned house, near the entrance of the colony. A friend of mine used to live there. Riku's commandeered it lately. I hear he wants to establish his own workshop there."</p>
<p>"A <strong>workshop!!!</strong>" Nikol was getting excited about that.</p>
<p>"<strong>Ohhh</strong>, that tickled your fancy, did it, Nikol?" Matthew exclaimed.</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah, I-I really wanna check out his setup! Can we go now?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ahahah, sure thing, kid. Let's go and say hi before we bunk down."</p>

<p>The setting sun painted a brown-orange hue against the walls with dark patches. Dunban's{{footnote: If you watched XC1, in this case, one don't care to do a spoiler.}} house was clearly out of service. The racks and instruments that looked like used for cooking were still there, but were badly damaged. The floor were stones of various shapes and sizes fitted like a jigsaw puzzle. The group, including Rex and Shulk's group, found Riku already waiting for them here on the ground floor of the 2-storey house. "Friends finally come. Riku was tired of waiting."</p>
<p>"Riku, nice to meetcha. I'm Matthew."</p>
<p>Nikol excitedly jumped to the point, "We heard from Shulk that you're setting up a workshop in here?"</p>
<p>"That correct. However, as friends can see, there nothing here as of yet. Riku cannot handle everything by self. That why request help with setting up of workshop space. Once workshop ready, will be able to use equipment to improve weapons, so there something in it for friends also," the final sentence intended as motivations to help him than to have him help himself.</p>
<p>"Upgrading weapons, eh? Well that's music to my ears." Rex exclaimed.</p>
<p>Linka added, "It's a welcome proposition for us too. Anything to improve the Liberators' military capabilities."</p>
<p>Nikol can't wait to get started, excitedly questioned, "So what can we do to help, fundamentally?"</p>
<p>"There two tasks Riku have in mind. Firstly, want to ask to collect Ravamantine at Exile Fortress Ruins."</p>
<p>He heard of that item before, "Ravamantine... You'll use that to make the workshop's furnace, right?"</p>
<p>"Precisely yes. Very astute, friend Nikol."</p>
<p>"Is that some kinda rare material, then?" asked Glimmer, sparkling with a tad bit of curiosity.</p>
<p>"It not rare to find if know where to look. But knowing place to look, that heart of issue. Exile Fortress Ruins is territory of Ignas, so cannot simply waltz inside."</p>
<p>"I hear ya. So that's where <strong>we</strong> come in." he punched his fist together, always excited for a fight.</p>
<p>A reminded him, not gonna rush in, "If we're to collect this material, we'll have to make sure we're adequately prepared."</p>
<p>He wasn't really listening, prompted next, "'K, so what's the other thing?"</p>
<p>"Friends must find hammer of Riku."</p>
<p>"Huh? That's it?"</p>
<p>He shuddered, like one did when there's nothing one can do about it, "From Riku point of view, this part take prime importance. Without it, can be no talk of upgrade weapons. But when returning to Colony 9 before, it get mixed up with other goods and not been seen since."</p>
<p>Shulk suggested, "If you say it was with other goods, then it might still be in the storage area."</p>
<p>Rex sighed, "We've gotta sift through all that stuff? That'll be a job and a half..."</p>
<p>A read the situation, "Well then, it seems prudent to leave that job for later."</p>
<p>Matthew decided, "Righto. So first, we find the Ravamantine, and then after that, Riku's hammer."</p>
<p>"Thanking in advance for help in both matters. Riku will stay here and continue prep-work."</p>
<hr />
<p>They got there so quick night had yet to fall. Roots dangling from the roof of the remains of the Castle; it loses two sides of its walls. On the ground were some mystical design that looked magical. The structure sits on what seems like green grass and rocky cliffs that, from this particular point of view, we can't decide where it was. There was a door on one of the remaining walls, while on the other wall was the remnants, looking like orange (amber) crystals that used to be liquid, leaked from the walls like magma, before it solidifies. At the center of the stage sits a king Ignas, which are two-legged lizard-looking creatures that had developed a civilization and had the ability to wield iron weapons. The door was behind the king Ignas, while to his left, within is view angle, was the crystal. In front of him was an aisle made by soldier Ignas looking toward each other, forming two lines on both sides.</p>
<p>Glimmer noted: "I see Ignas. Quite the number, too..."</p>
<p>A noted: "If we want to mine the mineral, we'll need to do something about the creatures first."</p>
<p>That way of solving stuff suits Matthew, "Looks like it... Nothing ever comes easy, eh? Well then, let's get this party rolling!"</p>
<hr />
<p>After knocking down the Ignas and gathered the Ravamantine, Matthew noted, "Cool, we got what we came for."</p>
<p>Shulk: "Next, let's find Riku's hammer for him. We should begin by searching through Colony 9's storage area."</p>
<hr />
<p>Boxes, boxes, and more boxes piled on top of each other, next to each other. The amount of storage stowed away was not little. The storage bath under the sun and rain all day, without a roof covering it. At night, the ether lamp illuminates a weak orange light, acting as a lighthouse to show where's where, but not bright enough to facilitate the search. No point gathering together over a single box when splitting up was the faster way to go. Perhaps tired of searching to no avail, Matthew asked A: "How's it looking? Have we got it?"</p>
<p>"Hm... I didn't see anything matching the description."</p>
<p>Rex, grooming: "Well, damn... I knew it'd be a hassle."</p>
<p>Some guy named Carrom, wearing armor with green short hair, bright shining turquoise iris, and brown skin, called out as he approached, "What's the matter? Looking for something?" They turned their attention turned to him.</p>
<p>Matthew answered him, "Yeah. Riku's lost his hammer somewhere. You seen anything like that?"</p>
<p>"Riku's hammer?" He was trying to recall from his memories. Hammer, hammer, hammer. Had one ever seen a hammer? After a while, he exclaimed, "<strong>Oh, I got it!</strong> I think I saw it. Had a Nopon-looking design. I remember thinking it was funky."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that sounds about right! Where'd you see it?"</p>
<p>"Hrm... I think we forwarded it to the supply office? Nobody could make heads or tails of it, so I think the guys were talking about trying to sell it or something..."</p>
<p>"<strong>No kidding?</strong> Well, at least it's a clue."</p>
<p>A deteriorated their hopes, "If it was indeed sold, the trouble won't end here..."</p>
<p>"I know that. Let's hurry to the supply office." No time to lose.</p>
<hr />
<p>The square where Panacea waited for them to linger around before taking them to the command center earlier, remember? The supply office was set up there, looking like a bazaar/shop, with tables on the shop front hosting a small ether lamp and a 'pail' of pencils, boxes behind. In front of the shop front laid mats of various colors. The supply manager stood on a red mat while he served his new customer, "Welcome, welcome. Anything you need?"</p>
<p>Matthew did the talking, "We're looking for a funky hammer. Got a Nopon-looking design on it... We hear it might've been sent here?"</p>
<p>That send him in deep thought. Hammer? Had he seen a hammer? Wait, that doesn't sound like the right word... What about...  "<strong>Oh yeahhh...!</strong> Funky's the word, all right. It seemed really tricky to use right."</p>
<p>"Bingo. Anyway, Riku wants it, so wouldja mind giving it back?"</p>
<p>He shook his head, "Right, about that... In the end, someone said they wanted to borrow it for a bit, and carried it off..."</p>
<p>"Just my luck... Someone, who?" Woof, better than tracking down if being sold. It would be much more difficult to ask for a favor when possessions changed hands and someone claimed authority over it thereafter.</p>
<p>"Erm... Sorry, I was working at the time so I didn't think to stop and question them... But I think they said they were going to use it in the central plaza? Sorry I can't be more help..." Oh yeah? At least something triggered.</p>
<p>"Right, I see..."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group gathered around for a discussion, Matthew started the questioning, "OK, so, what now?"</p>
<p>Rex suggested, "Can't be that many places in the central plaza where you'd expect to use a hammer."</p>
<p>Shulk agreed, "Good point. If we have a wander around, we may find it sooner than we think."</p>
<p>"Got it. This is turning into a real odyssey, but... that does seem quickest. Time to have a look around the plaza, then..." And they headed off to the plaza.</p>
<hr />
<p>There was a hammer with a black rubber/grip wrapped against the brown handle, and its tip was made of metal, the metal had some dizzy-eye encarvings, laying beside one of the legs of a tent. They were searching around when Nikol eyes laid on it. "Say, Matthew... Could that be Riku's hammer?"</p>
<p>Matthew walked up and lined with Nikol, while others gathered behind, "Hm, yeah, it doesn't exactly look like a normal hammer. We might've hit the jackpot."</p>
<p>Then, some girl called Saomi, with short blonde hair similar colored with Nikol's, and two horns growing from the top of her head, emerged from behind the metal cabinet. "Ohh, fizzlesparks! Clean forgot to put that thing away... It was, like, the perfect size for staking a tent, so I gave it a spin. Actually, more of a thwam, come to think of it!"</p>
<p>Matthew insisted, "Well, I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to ask you to return it. Its owner's been looking for it."</p>
<p>"Sure, I'm pretty much finished with it now. You go get that hammer home!" And she just walked away.</p>
<p>Matthew can't stand her reaction, spoke behind her back, "I can't believe some people. If you've finished the job, then return the tool, fool!" Looking back at the hammer, he was at least grateful, "Eh, guess I can let it slide. At least we've got the ore and the hammer for Riku now." It's called the 'Ultimate Hammer'.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Hey Riku, we're back!" called Matthew, walking past the entrance.</p>
<p>He turned his attention from whatever he was doing to them, asked, "Have friends got all needed things?"</p>
<p>They walked closer to each other, and Matthew handed him the items, "Sure do. 'Ere{{footnote: 'here'}}, the Ravamantine you ordered{{footnote: Like in a restaurant, eh!}}, and here's your hammer."</p>
<p>"<strong>Oho! Riku is over moon with joy.</strong> Now can put finishing touches on workshop, at long last. Please to wait outside a moment. Riku will be done in jiffy."</p>
<hr />
<p>Hammering and soldering, and we saw the new anvil and furnace set up. Such speed of crafting, not even modern industry machines could beat. Even the door sign was hammered on top of the roof beam in no time.</p>
<p>"This is crazy...!" exclaimed Nikol.</p>
<p>Shulk agreed, "Indeed. For an improvised workspace, it certainly is impressive... Though I'm not sure its previous tenant would have approved.{{footnote: Poor Dunban.}}"</p>
<p>"Riku make most of all resources that put at disposal of Riku. Is motto as craftypon, in fact."</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, great stuff. So can you upgrade our weapons now?" Matthew was more concerned with something else.</p>
<p>"Of course. Would friends care to try? First time come free."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ooh, get in!</strong> Well then, don't mind if I do!"</p>
<hr />
<p>"There, enstrengthenment complete. How is Blade feel?"</p>
<p>He summoned his gloves and tried some punches, "<strong>Ooh yeah, feels good!</strong> It's even more like it's part of me now."</p>
<p>"Riku pleased to hear. Incidentally, Matthew."</p>
<p>"Yes?" He sheathed his blade while asking him to go on.</p>
<p>"Where did friend obtain that Blade?"</p>
<p>"What, this? Uhm... Well, my grandad used it, originally. Grandad gave it to my pops{{footnote: i.e. father}}, he gave it to me, and now it's all mine. That sorta deal."</p>
<p>"Riku see."</p>
<p>"Why'd you ask?"</p>
<p>"No particular reason. Riku simply bit curious. Blade is good quality. Riku hope friend can make good use of for long time yet."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's the plan."</p>
<p>"Hmm..." A had been watching their interactions, perhaps knew something they don't.</p>
<p>"Riku ready to improve all friends' weapons in workshop in future also. However, rule of B.O.O.M. apply. That stands for 'bring one's own materials'."</p>
<p>"Gotcha. Hope you're ready to get worked hard, mister!" Matthew will be visiting very often!</p>
<hr />
<p>Exiting the tent, Matthew turned to the others, noted, "Right then, that's the business sorted. Shall we get back to the tents and rest?" The others were excited for a sleep after a hard day's work!</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-5"><a class="header" href="#footnotes-5">Footnotes:</a></h3>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="nael"><a class="header" href="#nael">Na'el</a></h1>
<p>The day's bright, the sky blue. It's rare to see Matthew up so early, for Glimmer and Nikol were only joining him and A. The campfire was forever burning, day and night. "Righty-ho... I'll go have a chat with Dillon. I wanna ask how all the City folk have been getting on. Got any plans yourselves?"</p>
<p>"I think I'll pay a visit to the command center. I want to see what Shulk's up to."</p>
<p>"And I'll... umm... I don't know. What should I do?"</p>
<p>"If you're bored, you can come with me. I need to pick up a few things at the market." Glimmer suggested to her now friend.</p>
<p>"Yeah, uh-uhm... OK."</p>
<p>"Right then, catch you in a bit." And they split off.</p>
<hr />
<p>Several water fell off the cliff in the distance. Below the waterfall were somewhere near Colony 9. They were on top of a hill, overlooking the beautiful scenery, but their attention was on something else, despite the serenity.</p>
<p>"Right... So you haven't seen Na'el..."</p>
<p>"<em>I'm really sorry, Matthew. It was hard enough for the six of us to escape. But hey, it wasn't just <strong>our</strong> group. I hear Naomi's group made it out as well. There's a chance... she's with them.</em>"</p>
<p>"Naomi?"</p>
<p>"<em>Seems Caleb tried to stop them, but they weren't able to hear him.</em> We think they were headed towards Fornis. Except... <em>he said he was too far away to see who was <strong>actually</strong> with her.</em>"</p>
<p>"Right..."</p>
<p>"<em>This is Na'el, though. But she's with them, A-OK. She's like you, mate.</em> Hard as nails and <strong>twice</strong> as tough."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh..." But hey, no, she's not. The long time he had with her, and he sworn to protect her; he sees her as someone to be protected, to live in what she's really happy about, and not immersed in war. His worries doesn't diminish therefore.</p>
<hr />
<p>Shulk was reading on a book, his butt on the edge of the table, when Rex arrived. "<em>You've got it <strong>so</strong> much easier, you know. At least yours is well-behaved.</em>"</p>
<p>He raised his head from the book he's reading, "You're jealous? That's a surprise."</p>
<p>"<em>That's- not- what I mean.</em>" He looked away.</p>
<p>He looked down, recalling their encounters, "Nothing about this is easy. There's this <strong>awkward</strong> distance between us. I'm just lucky that things panned out this way."</p>
<p>"<em>Is that right?</em>"</p>
<p>"It's all about how to handle things in the moment. That's the crux of it, <em>or at least I think so.</em>" Starting to share experiences, eh!</p>
<p>"<em>Hrmm...</em>" He started shaking his head.</p>
<p>"You were independent from a young age, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... <em>Well, apart from Gramps sticking to me like glue.</em>" That was memories. "But I supported myself."</p>
<p>"That explains it, then. The way you think of her,... as being somehow different from you." He stood up and put his notebook on the table, had his attention on him, "<em>The paths you've walked are too unfamiliar. No?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Hmm...</em>"</p>
<p>"Try talking to her again... but be yourself." And thinking himself, putting his fingers in a V under his chin, "Actually..."</p>
<p>"<em>Um?</em>"</p>
<p>"Perhaps... she'll be the one who comes to you."</p>
<p>"<em>Hm.</em>" He crossed arms.</p>
<p>Just then, someone was shouting for them, "<strong>Hey Shulk! And Rex!</strong>" Rex turned around to saw a brown skin guy stopping near them, announcing the news before they asked what happened, "<strong>The search party's returned!</strong>"</p>
<p>Both: "<strong>Huh!</strong>" Now that was some news.</p>
<hr />
<p>By the bridge entrance, Shulk, Rex, Panacea, Linka, Riku, and the main group's all four had gathered where the search party was. A white skin guy with wings sat down in front of the first two, drinking water while explaining the situation, and Shulk repeated, "You've not found a <strong>single</strong> person?"</p>
<p>"There were clear signs of combat, that's it. But... As I've informed you, we've not been able to confirm any survivors. There were no husks present either, so I'd expect it to have been monsters."</p>
<p>Rex wasn't very convinced, "But even then... can't see the whole <strong>group</strong> croaking it. Nagae's unit? <em>Shoulda been the cream of the crop.</em>"</p>
<p>"Mhm." Shulk agreed.</p>
<p>"Any case, we brought back anything we could find on the scene." The table behind, a short orange hair girl overseen all the equipment laid out. Some helmets, weapons, ids, and some cylinders. "Most objects belonged to the unit, <strong>but</strong>... there were also a few oddities." He walked over to the table while Shulk asked,</p>
<p>"Namely?"</p>
<p>"According to Carrom, things that may have potentially belonged to City refugees."</p>
<p>"<strong>Whuh!</strong>" Now Matthew was alerted. Anything related to the City would mean news of Na'el. His eyes wide opened, studying the accessories on the table for any things that might be related to her. There was something small that laid in between all the equipment, a band alternating red and green that seemed to tied around the wrist broken caught his eye but not the others. "<strong>HUH!!!</strong>" He immediately took steps towards it, announced, "<strong>I KNOW THIS!!!</strong>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Na'el was speaking to him overlooking the square and the child when they were discussing their difference in goals. She pulled up her sleeve to revealed a band alternating green and red tied around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He took it up and shouted to the winged guy, aggressively, "<strong>OI! WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS?!!! THIS BELONGED TO NA'EL!!! TELL ME!!!</strong>" And he took steps forward, as if he's going to pick on him; and the winged guy backed away at such aggressiveness.</p>
<p>In a frightened tone, "Li-Like I said, the location of the S.O.S."</p>
<p>"Is that true?! <strong>You better not be lying!</strong>"</p>
<p>A was watching his reactions coolly all the time, called out, "<strong>Matthew.</strong>" He's losing his mind, she need to watch over her.</p>
<p>His pride overrode his fear, "It is, I'm not. It was with everything else, on the ground by a tree."</p>
<p>"<em>Oh no... Na'el...</em>" His body drooped, his strength faded. A watched as he lose his motivation. What can she say? What had she seen?{{footnote: If you hadn't already know, she had foresight, as stated earlier when Glimmer ran away.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>Still, at the same place, but the search team members were already gone with the other stuffs. "<em>Huh...</em>" Matthew still couldn't accept the highly-probable fact.</p>
<p>"Matthew..."</p>
<p>Panacea asked, "This, 'Na'el'... She a relative of yours?"</p>
<p>"She's my little sister. I've been looking for her for <strong>so</strong> long."</p>
<p>"Right..."</p>
<p>No time to linger, "Hey, Linka, where was that emergency transmission coming from?"</p>
<p>"According to the search team, somewhere in the vicinity of Raguel Lake."</p>
<p>He nodded to her, then walked towards the bridge himself, his steps stiff and certain, but he won't look back. Rex called out, "<strong>Oi</strong>, stop right there! You're not seriously planning to head out there alone?"</p>
<p>"Uh, yeah? <strong>This is my problem, nobody else's. I've gotta see it for myself.</strong>"</p>
<p>Linka: "Raguel Lake is quite a distance from here. I'd strongly recommend that you at least take <em>some</em> kind of <strong>escort</strong>..."</p>
<p>He turned around and started venting, "<strong>You don't get it! I finally have a lead! If whoever</strong> attacked the search party <strong>still</strong> there, <strong>all the more reason for me to go, and rescue her!</strong>"</p>
<p>Rex: "<strong>All right, all right, keep your shorts on. Nobody's tellin' you no</strong> here."</p>
<p>Shulk explained, "We were planning to head there as well in fact. A whole search party taken out is no trivial matter."</p>
<p>He apologized after listening, "Sorry. I didn't mean to go off on you."</p>
<p>"No need. We don't really have the luxury of time, it's true." Thinking stance, "Then I suppose it's time to use the Ether Slide."</p>
<p>"Ether... Slide?" Glimmer had not heard of that object before. What is it?</p>
<p>"Take a look over here." He then walked them towards the edge of the gated cliff, where the bridge is in the distance. The ground had no particular details, only a patch of sandy soil that looked not very natural to the grassy surroundings; why had grass not grown there? "An Ether Slide is, <em>well</em>... Put simply, it's a method of conveyance that uses the flow of ether for propulsion. You can think of it as, sliding along a wire, made of ether. Using an Ether Slide would get us pretty close to Raguel Lake."{{footnote: Because the Ether Slide is charged with energy, the difference with a plain wire is, a plain wire is powered by gravity, and so you can only slide from higher place to lower; but an Ether Slide's energy allowed you to overcome gravity and slide from a lower location to one's higher.}}</p>
<p>Panacea showed off the Great Contributors names, "Teacher and Riku developed this technology together. <strong>Amazing, or what?</strong>"</p>
<p>Only the other guy whom knew mechanics got excited first, "<strong>Yes, it's really impressive...! The technology is fascination...!</strong>"</p>
<p>Shulk took the opportunity at hand, "<strong>Hah!</strong>{{footnote: With trembled breathe, perhaps nervous.}} If- you're so curious about it, would you mind, lending me a hand?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Absolutely!</strong>" He then ran forward to him.</p>
<p>"Let me give you the necessary materials." He took it from his pocket and handed them to him.{{footnote: As usual, they had infinite storage space in their pockets. Game is game.}} 2 Trial Black Shards, 3 Wool Rock, and 1 Ether Cylinder.</p>
<p>He glanced and observed them, noticed, "Hmm... What- odd- ether crystal structure."</p>
<p>Shulk explained, "The ether in these was <strong>transformed</strong> due to the effects of the black fog. I call them, Black Shards."</p>
<p>"So, they only form where there's black fog." He asked while tucking the items into his pocket.</p>
<p>"That's right. They're... <strong>preeeetty</strong> rare, annnnd all the more valuable for it. That said, we need them when building the <strong>ether</strong> amplifiers used to project the wires."</p>
<p>"Got it..."</p>
<p>"Right, that'll do for exposition. Let's get to crafting the equipment."</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, can't wait!</strong>"</p>
<p>The Ether slide item looked like two horseshoe shaped arranged perpendicular to each other, the thicker and longer one on top of the thinner and shorter one, and both mounted on a cone that fixed to the ground. That two horseshoe form a gyroscope, which can rotate. Controlling the direction of the place they want to go, which is the higher-up cliff on the other side{{footnote: the bridge only reach the lower part of the cliff, and there's no way to climb up immediately available; and no, they prefer not to use a ladder because it's too low tech.}}, an ether line shot and attached itself to the edge of the cliff at the higher platform.</p>

There was an old ruin that had ladders walking up them. The ladder walk up to a transit-platform with grass growing on it, and turn right to walk up another steps of ladders to reach the penultimate top of the platform. There laid another higher platform reached by another set of ladders, and there was an arc like Triomphe at one side of the structure. The 'windows' of the structure looked like the ones from the Roman Colosseum. Plants already stuck their roots into the dull-colored structure.</p>
<p>Glimmer asked, "What is this place? Looks older than Colony 9 by far..."</p>
<p>Rex answered, "To be honest with you, it's a <strong>super-ancient</strong> ruin. And when I say 'super', I mean <strong>ultra-mega-ancient</strong>."</p>
<p>"Yeah??? Buildings made of stone... That's pretty primitive, all right."</p>
<p>"Hey now, it's <strong>'primitive'</strong> buildings like <strong>these</strong> that are still standing <strong>today</strong>. Admittedly, there's not as much left <strong>standing</strong> as when I saw it the last time... <em>But still.</em> You can <strong>feel</strong> the <strong>magnificent weight of history</strong>, right?!"</p>
<p>"Huh... S'pose?" The emphasis that Rex tried to use did not appeal to Glimmer.</p>
<p>"Wow... Tough crowd. Mm, I guess it figures..."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group arrived at the battle zone, a ground without grass (scorched), surrounded by one with. Panacea took out her comms and scanned for signals, noting after a while, "No traces of Ouroboros power being used."</p>
<p>"Huuuh..." Perhaps he was relieved; if she was in danger, why would she not had used it?</p>
<p>Linka knelt down and noticed other stuffs, "Plenty of footprints though. <em>Although... they seem to all be</em> from search party boots."</p>
<p>"Nothing else at all?" Rex couldn't believed their findings. "Gotta be some trace of the refugees."</p>
<p>"Ohhh, there's something all right. <em>But it's weird.</em>"</p>
<p>"Weird how?" Shulk asked.</p>
<p>"There are tracks leading up to here, but... <em>nothing to suggest that anyone left.</em>"</p>
<p>Rex questioningly concluded, "<em>So... do we think they were done in?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>HRRRR</strong>"</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry." Rex didn't meant to pluck the string in Matthew.</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Somewhere near, the group had set up camps to rest, seeing the sky's turning dark. They were split into 2 groups, one with Shulk talking to Rex, while Glimmer and Linka listened; another with Nikol sitting with his feet forming an angle on a mat, while Panacea to his left, A and Riku to his right. They left their belongings in between the two groups. Lush tall trees, giant rocks the height of their chest, and dense light green grass, plus other bushes to differentiate the flora and fauna a little.</p>
<p>Matthew sat by himself at one of the large rocks, needing silence and alone time. He took the braces that the search party had brought back on his left, while holding out a photo of Na'el against some plains with rocks on a bright morning on his right. The thought of her dying, he can't believe it. But he couldn't find any signs of her on the place of battle, either. What could he do? Memories drifted backwards.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="start-of-memories"><a class="header" href="#start-of-memories">Start of memories</a></h5>
<p>Na'el was leading Matthew, Dillon, and other City soldiers, exhaustingly panting as they ran in between short cliffs on a barren road. They were arriving at a cave entrance and saw fire had already consumed their destination. Corpses lied barren in random locations around burning rubble.</p>
<p>"Ugh, oh, no..." Despair washed over her as those of her brethren live no longer. Slowly but certainly, yellow motes dissipated from the fallen, and soon they'll evaporate. From left to right, she scanned for who's dear. "<strong>Hoh!</strong>" The girl in the distance caught her attention. Immediately, she dashed to where her corpse was; the child whom asked her to visit and bring a piano with <em>her</em> to entertain her laid lifeless. "<strong>HUUUUHHH URGHUH!</strong>" She knelt and skidded, stopping just before her corpse, her eyes on her face, hoping she still could be saved. She took her shoulder in her arms, brought it close to her chest, hoping the warm emanated would breathe life back into her. "<strong>Urggggh Urgggghhh... Chyra... Nghhhh Nghuhhhhh...</strong>"</p>
<p>Matthew followed slowly behind her, quietly called out "<em>Na'el...</em>" as his sympathy connected with her. But steps were approaching, attracting his attention. Kevesi soldiers. "Huh!"</p>
<p>"Hehehehe..." The head had just enjoyed a massacre when another is waiting for them. The leader with slighly dark skin and ruby-red iris, dark crimson hair 'proved' his point to his colleagues, "<em>See? What did I tell you? I was sure they'd show up.</em>" TNa'el was still crying over Chyra while they talked; the soldiers were of no importance to her; but Chyra was.</p>
<p>"Be sure to strip their corpses. We'll be eating fine this week!"</p>
<p>She hadn't cried enough, but Chyra already evaporated all. She held out her trembling fingers, trying to feel the remains; only left is her memories. No, doctors could not bring back what's already gone. A loud thud in her chest, she felt the weight against her heart. All personal belongings that don't return, was what souvenirs that memories anchor. "Pfffhhh..." Tears rolled down her cheeks, all beliefs gone from this moment. Peace, you say? To hell with it. Slowly but surely, she got on her feet, nothing to hold her down. Looking behind, "<strong>URGGGGHHHHHHH ARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!</strong>" Despair raged, sadness scorched, hopelessness burn; feelings directed at the cause. She dashed, her blades like fan wit blades, but formed the angle like an umbrella; and repeat that again for both hands, towards the soldiers. Not long after, red motes filled the origin as all soldiers fell, their life withdrew from their corpses. She was tired, but standing. Sheathed her blade, her goals forever changed, her smiles no more. All subjects fell, she could no longer redirect despair externally. The other City folks still hadn't joined the fight, blades in hand, watched in awe.</p>
<p>"Ohhhh..." was Matthew's reaction.</p>
<p>"<em>Why...?</em> <strong>WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LEAVE US THE HELL ALONE?!!!</strong>" Her shouts reverberate through the caves, echoed the valley. Only black smoke rose from the burnings of the remnants; can they even hear her?</p>
<hr />
<p>At the City, the 'first'/original City, Matthew and Na'el stood on one side of the line, and some other City folks with them and on the other side of the line, forming a central alleyway for City folks to bring Kevesi and Agnian soldiers into the City. A process of reforming, perhaps, to escape from the cycle? Or perhaps, a process of injecting new blood for the City.</p>
<p>"Huh..." She clenched her fist, gritted her teeth, no longer understanding, blurted between her lips, "<strong>Why</strong> are we bringing <strong>those</strong> <em>people</em> with us?!"</p>
<p>All stopped, "<em>Huh...</em>" and some felt uneasy. "Oh..." "Urgh..."</p>
<p>"Drop it, Na'el."</p>
<p>"<strong>Matthew!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>You know why. Surely.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah, but...</strong>"</p>
<p>"Some of our folk were soldiers. Spare a thought for them, yeah?"</p>
<p>"<em>Makes no sense.</em>"</p>
<p>"Na'el."</p>
<p>"<strong>HAVEN'T we done enough?! We could've just</strong> kept to ourselves, <strong>but we're STILL, DOING THIS! And now Chyra's dead!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Urgh...</em>" How could he pat her on the back? He doesn't even know what to do with it.</p>
<p>"Hmph!" And she dashed off into the distance. Everyone watched her off, said nothing. Not even Matthew tried to stop her. Perhaps, he thought, time will calm things down. But no, some stuff, not even time could calm down; it only get worse and worse, like an infinitely large dry logs lit on flames that spread.</p>
<hr />
<p>In her room, she sat by the dark. The moonlight from the windows shone into her one-storey room, at her bed. The only other light that barely produced illumination was from the fireplace; but that does not kept her warm. The cold tingling feel crawled down her skin as her memories recurrently repeat over and over the loss of whom she'd seen growing up, and attached so much emotion. She hadn't even grew up and experience the world for herself!</p>
<p>The metallic door squeaked open and Matthew's voice called, "Na'el? You here? Why ya in the dark?" He reached for the switch.</p>
<p>"<em>Go away...</em>" He stopped.</p>
<p>A car drove through; its headlight so tall and wide the lights illuminate the room from the windows a little more brighter; at least bright enough to show the photo of Grandad as a baby in his mom's hands, accompanied by his dad.  The car passed through, only moonlight remains.</p>
<p>"With or without Moebius, nothing will change... In the end, people- always- kill- people."</p>
<p>Matthew walked nearer to him, trying to convince her, "Those soldiers were <em>still part of the cycle.</em> I bet... they were controlled."</p>
<p>"Doubt it. No red Irises." She crossed her arms around her chest, as if that would kept her warm, "<strong>Savages...</strong> They killed Chyra just to add on a measly few extra days..."</p>
<p>"<em>Come on. That's worst case.</em>"</p>
<p>He's not even trying to understand her. Reasonings don't work. Neither do opposite ends of emotions{{footnote: optimistic vs pessimistic}}. "Matthew... Always in fantasy land."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"<strong>You can't keep every bloody person happy! How can you not understand it's impossible?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"The only true end is the moment you give up. Isn't that what Grandad taught us?"</p>
<p>She stood up from where she sat, shouted back immediately, "<strong>Then show me already! This world of peace, where nobody has to die, make it come true! You think you can do that, do you?! You think you've got what it takes?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"I,I... <em>Huh...</em>" He had no answers for her, looked aside feeling guilty.</p>
<p>She continued, "<strong>Well I don't... I'm barely holding on! You hear me?!</strong>" And she rushed out the door. He watched her, but not going after her, feeling heavy himself,</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>"</p>
<h5 id="end-of-memories"><a class="header" href="#end-of-memories">End of memories</a></h5>
<hr />
<p>"We can't yet be sure that she's dead." A interrupted his dreams. "Even the footprints. The search party's little skirmish could be <strong>wholly</strong> unrelated to this."</p>
<p>"In my head, I get it, yeah. 'Cept{{footnote: Except}}... in my heart of hearts... <em>Urgh</em>... <strong>I bloody hate this.</strong>"</p>
<p>"You hate what?"</p>
<p>"<strong>These stupid bodies we have. If only we turned into husks, the same way that soldiers do...</strong> But no, we vanish without a trace. No evidence, nothing."</p>
<p>"I understand your unease. But... Keep heart."</p>
<p>"I know, I know..." Sensing someone approaching, they looked towards the shadows. Rex and Shulk were walking towards them. "You fellas... Can I help you?"</p>
<p>"Food's up. Saved you some. C'mon. Everyone's havin' a blast." Rex invited.</p>
<p>"I'm not depressed or anything."</p>
<p>"Heh. Oh, I know you're not. That's not what I was <em>implying.</em>"</p>
<p>Shulk explained, "We're having a... little shindig."</p>
<hr />
<p>Sitting round the campfire. Shulk and Rex specifically wanted to talk to Matthew, accompanied by A. Shulk started first, "Matthew..." He raised his head, and he continued, "I don't suppose you'd mind, <strong>telling</strong> us? About your sister? What happened to Na'el, and so on?"</p>
<p>"Huh..." Such surprising request.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't want to force you."</p>
<p>Still feeling down, he agreed, "Nah, it's fine. All right. It happened on the day the City fell..."</p>
<h5 id="start-of-memories-2"><a class="header" href="#start-of-memories-2">Start of Memories 2</a></h5>
<p>"Huh huh huh" Pant pant pant, he exhaustedly dashed through burning rubble. All he had seen was black smoke enshrouding his vision, but he had no difficulty navigating the routes from memory, despite fallen buildings, signs, corpses, and wandering levnises.</p>
<p>"Moebius..." He paused for a while before continuing to his destination, using the thick smoke as a cover against being seen, shouting, "<strong>Na'el!</strong>" No, the thick smoke also clouded his vision; but now he's near enough, he could see. "<strong>GRANDAD!!!</strong>" The City folks were protected within a beam of light like a large burning flame. At the center of the square was the sword stabbed right in his heart. "<strong>Huh!</strong>"</p>
<p>There, Grandad held tight onto the sword, preventing the golden mask Moebius from moving it inwards, nor could he pull it out. The force was in balance as they wrestle for control. "<em>Matthew...</em>"</p>
<p>Matthew rushed towards the injured, trying to be the one breaking the balance, "<strong>Grandad!</strong>"</p>
<p>But too late. He started releasing the Ouroboros power to its maximum limits (self-exploding{{footnote: 自爆}}), his soul started to pushed out of his husk, his speeches quickened, "<em>Take care of... Na'el... the future...</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>GRANDAD!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>It's in your hands, Matthew!</em>" His feet were still moving forward when the gigantic green ball pushed the boundaries. It reached out for Na'el and the City folks, and reached out for Matthew, and reached out for everybody, like a nuclear explosion that swallowed everything in its vicinity. All buildings burst into rubble; but the ball of energy contained a will to only push those living out than destroy them like those inanimate.</p>
<p>"<strong>ARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!</strong>"</p>
<h5 id="end-of-memories-2"><a class="header" href="#end-of-memories-2">End of Memories 2</a></h5>
<p>Glimmer and the others had already gathered around, listening to the storytelling from his side of the story. "When I came to, I was all... cuts and bruises."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew lying on the ground, unconscious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Back then, A was the one that nursed me back to life."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The surrounding was ground and grass; no sign of the City.{{footnote: Don't know how he flew so far away. No signs of nuclear blast, black floor, either.}} A approached him from nowhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Found me while traveling, apparently by pure chance."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Together, after he awake, they dashed towards the center of impact. There was a huge hole made. They stopped beside the hole. "Huh..." At the center of the pit was burning rubble.</p>
<hr />
<p>Later on, A stood beside Matthew as he knelt on the ground, putting flowers on a memorial stone that had no encarvings on it.{{footnote: We saw this scene earlier in the chapters.}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shulk: "I see... That's why..."</p>
<p>"It's not just that. It's him too... The Moebius <strong>bastard</strong>... I'll wring his neck with my bare hands. <strong>I swear it.</strong>" And he tightened his fist. A was looking at him; perhaps she had something to say that she don't know if she wanted to say it or not? Shulk was meanwhile looking at A's reaction. They hadn't yet talked.</p>
<hr />
<p>Where all seemed to be asleep, A was looking over the lake herself, standing under the blanket of the stars. Shulk arrived and stood beside her, nobody else in sight, commented, "You've hardly changed, to my eyes."</p>
<p>"You're saying I'm like him? No need to throw it in my face."</p>
<p>"Hmph. So why do you look like that?"</p>
<p>"Logos was the male persona." Rex explained, attracting their attention. "And Pneuma the female one. Ontos was meant to stand somewhere between. Forming the <strong>Trinity Processor.</strong> It all adds up to me."</p>
<p>"I see..." the attention was turned back to A; and she nodded, accepted his rationalization. "Does Matthew know?" She shook her head. "So about you and Alpha... What happened? How did you split apart?"</p>
<p>"It was unforeseen."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The golden-mask Moebius slashed towards Na'el, breaking her Blades apart as she tried to defend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"For that Moebius and man... to have that kind of power."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After Grandad exploded, his soul turned around and reached for Na'el. Na'el didn't even have the time to react, to the last moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"To my fortune, it unshackled me. From the chains of Ontos."</p>
<p>"Chains?"</p>
<p>"As you may know... And this is surely evident to you, Shulk. But Origin... It's based upon the architecture of Ontos's core."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By a seaside so wide, surrounded by mountains on the far side{{footnote: Actually, a horn-like stone structure. And one didn't mention the hole where seawater fall to an abyss.}}. On this side was very shallow, like Maldives on the verge of sinking if seawater raised just a bit. That guy, short, blonde hair, wearing a red jacket, apparently a younger version of Shulk, walked on the beach towards some orange-red crystal washed up on the beach. It was a cross similar to the ones wearing on A's ear. He picked it up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I heard about that from Melia. A gift from Alvis, she called it."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three crystals like the ones wearing on A's earring, on each side of the triangle, fitted into the machine. The Trinity Processor had a hexagon in the middle, with tubes on 3 sides that connect to 3 larger hexagons where the 3 crystals were fitted onto. Energy flowed through the crystal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Ontos, was the arbiter... And thus, was predicated on the existence, or perhaps the opinions, of the others, Logos, and Pneuma."</p>
<p>Rex concluded her words, "In short... Without the two of them present, Ontos was just a machine."</p>
<p>She agreed his conclusion. "My original, he was shaped by Klaus, and shouldered the man's regret, as he was born into that world.{{footnote: Check out the story of Xenoblade 2 endings before final boss for this.}} Hence, he was able to help you." Then she dropped his head, "But he is no longer... The 'me' that is left, is just a machine. And machines know no sympathy. That's why... he took steps... to erase this world."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alvis released a huge burst of energy that dragged Z, Shulk, and Rex backwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"To create a new future in its place. Debris of the past, and the noise that permeates the present. Your lives are to him... redundant. His conclusion: that only new life, that of the people of the City, ought to be preserved. Ontos proclaimed himself 'Alpha', and chose to leave for a new world, shepherding the Citizens along with him... while erasing the old world in his wake."</p>
<p>"However, N's intrusion caused something of a setback." And she nodded. N is the golden-mask Moebius.</p>
<p>"That is not all it did. In any case, I was able to separate from Alpha. The memories, of traveling with you, and all other faint recollections... They compose me."</p>
<p>"Mm."</p>
<p>"You could call me his conscience."</p>
<p>There was a short pause, before Rex asked, "So, here's what this conscience or whatever is saying, then. There's no life that deserves to be left behind. All life is worth saving, more or less." Is that where she stood?</p>
<p>"Yes, that's the gist of it. I suspect that if Logos or Pneuma were here now, they would surely say the same thing."</p>
<p>The Pneuma that became his wife; and the Logos that he fought as final enemy in his travel; he knows them the most here. "Yeah, I bet... So why tag along with the kid?"</p>
<p>"You've good reason, don't you?" Shulk also wanted to know why.</p>
<p>"For Alpha to command some form of power in this world, he needs a body to inhabit. Yes, like how, Zanza, once lived in you. And Matthew's sister-..."</p>
<p>Before she could finished, a beam of light commencing intense energy stroke the ground behind her. She sensed it beforehand, looked behind and saw such orange beam like a lightning stroke from up in the sky, scorching the ground red hot, turning it magna. The intense energy it released, brushing against air particles, swooshed and formed a shockwave that pushed further out into the lake and other parts of the land. A female with cat ears, gray hair, wore a mask, and the wings that attached to her armor looked like frozen chocolate; she slowly walked towards them.</p>
<p>Back at the camp, the others felt the intense shockwave. Matthew was meditating when it came. Nervously, he called out, "<strong>Wh-what's this?! This wind!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Over by the lake!</strong>" Nikol stood up as he was ready to check it out. All of them leave for the lake.</p>
<p>The three already by the lake were in defense mode, although they hadn't summon their weapons yet. They watched as the girl walked slowly horizontally in front of them; they occasionally tilt their body to ensure they were always facing her.</p>
<p>As she was walking, the others also arrived from afar, stopping a distance from her.  This someone, Matthew felt familiar. She turned her attention to him, spoke, "I've come to fetch you, Matthew."</p>
<p>"<strong>HUHUHUHUH!!!</strong>" He was literally gasping for breathe.</p>
<p>"Come... It's time to go." She sheathed her mask, revealed her identity. Na'el held out both her hands, as if to welcome him. Though, now she don't have her diamond rainbow-colored core crystal in her chest, replaced by an Ontos core.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-6"><a class="header" href="#footnotes-6">Footnotes:</a></h3>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="alpha"><a class="header" href="#alpha">Alpha</a></h1>
<p>The Great Sword loomed high in the sky not far away. Where they are, the two rocks to both side of the entrance, large greenish-copper crystals grew. Trees anchored their roots into the cliffs. The City people seemed to be searching for something, spreading out at the field overgrown by grass knee-high. While they were busy, Matthew's eyes found Na'el by the beach herself, overlooking the gulf where seawater joined. She pulled up her sleeve, revealing the wristband she wore, unsure where's her mind on.</p>
<p>Matthew approached her, wanted to converse, but were disturbed by some abhorrent wolf creatures emitting black smoke, its skin surface scorched with lava-like flames. Step by step they took towards them. Matthew first noticed; Na'el's was still daydreaming and reacted slightly later. Eventually, they summoned their blades and prepared for battle.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ouroboros power emanated from them, the creatures were down. "Are you all right? Na'el?"</p>
<p>She looked away, blandly replied, "I'm fine."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>" She still haven't walked out of the shadow, huh. Not sure how to deal with that now, he turned his attention to the creatures, questioned, "What were those things all about? They were giving me Moebius scrab vibes, but they weren't the same." As they spoke, the creatures evaporated into dust{{footnote: NOT motes.}}.</p>
<p>"<strong>Matthew! What happened?</strong>" Some City fellows alerted ran after them.</p>
<p>The leading fellow was a short-brown-haired guy. "Ah, hey Oren. It's fine. We're all good."</p>
<p>"Was it Moebius?"</p>
<p>"Nah... Some... new kinda breed of monster. Took 'em down, and they vanished into <strong>thin</strong> air."</p>
<p>"<strong>Don't scare me like that! I thought... since you used the Ouroboros power, it had to be Moebius.</strong>"</p>
<p>One of his accompaniments wearing poison-gas mask rebut, "C'mon, that's crazy talk. It's been like fifteen years since we last <strong>tussled</strong> with Moebius."{{footnote: Too long time of peace really is not good for us, eh! Makes us decadent. We need constant war to keep vigilant.}}</p>
<p>"Yeah, I suppose so..."</p>
<p>Matthew changed the subject to their target here, "How're we for ether?"</p>
<p>The poison-mask guy took it out from his pocket, "See for yourself." A full canister of bioluminescent ether.</p>
<p>"Right on. So it looks like we've met the quota. Shall we head?"</p>
<p>"Mm." Both agreed.</p>
<p>"Na'el?" He saw her looking at the other side, heartlessly answered,</p>
<p>"Mm." Still, she don't forgive me, huh... And he walked away biting his lips for a while. Na'el waited for them to walked a little longer before turning to follow up. While she was following, something shiny by the beach stood out at the tip of her eyes. Something... red. "Hm?"</p>
<p>Curious, she approached the object. It was Ontos's core. The 'red blood cells' within it flowed in a clockwise motion, giving it an appealing red. She picked it up, observed, and some voice rung in her ears:</p>
<p>"<em>Let us away... Towards a new world... Out with the old. And in once more, with the new...</em>"</p>
<p>"Hrrr huuuh!" Is that not her wish? Is that not what she wanted the most right now? The world of peace, where there would be no war? The crystal appealed so much to her her eyes stretched to its limit as if it were going to break. Her vibrating iris revealed her shaken heart. Can she? Can she really?</p>
<p>"Na'el."</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh!</strong>" The voice of Matthew had brought him back to the present moment. Still holding the crystal by her hand, she saw Matthew and the others had turned back, seeing she hadn't caught up with them, at a distance away. "What's the matter with you? <strong>Shake a leg!</strong>"</p>
<p>It's not time to reveal that crystal yet. Calmly tucked it into the pocket of her coat, she tried her best to keep being 'normal', "<em>Uh, sorry... Coming</em>." Together, they went off into the distance.</p>
<p>While they were on their way home, "Mm..." her thoughts lingered on the voices she heard.</p>
<p>"Na'el. What were you up to back there?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" That brought her attention out of her daydreams.</p>
<p>"You were... kinda... spaced-out."</p>
<p>"<em>Not really. Huuuuuhhh...</em>" Can she speak of the heavy rocks that is currently crushing her heart? With enough courage and internal urges, she called,  "Matthew..."</p>
<p>But she hadn't even had the chance. He was interrupted by comms signal. Activating his iris as he stopped, he asked, "What's up?"</p>
<p>"This Matthew?" someone from the other side said that for fun, immediately continued without clarification, "Listen. We could do with a little help over here." Oren and the others overheard and turned back, gathered around him to hear the news. "Bit of a snafu."</p>
<p>"Volffs, eh?"{{footnote: Wait, you could see?}}</p>
<p>"More of 'em than we expected."</p>
<p>"No rest for the wicked. Copy that. I'll head over. You want me at Daedal Isle, right?"</p>
<p>"That's it. Thanks."</p>
<p>"Dillon, eh?" asked Oren. He recognized the voice.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Says they're having trouble with Volffs. Gonna lend 'em a hand."</p>
<p>"Damn. They've really been multiplying. "</p>
<p>"Sure looks like it." Then, he apologized, "My bad, Na'el. I'll catch you up later."</p>
<p>Her eyes widened, subconsciously replied, "Uh, 'Kay." But there's no more latter. Not that one could summon such courage a second time if the time's no longer right. And she saw him running off himself, leaving behind her and the other City soldiers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back at the City, people were walking along the metallic road; man, women, elderly, children. Some gathered around and have fun in front of someone's door; or perhaps it was some place else, cause one saw ladder attached to the wall. The wall lights, one of them, shone right at the window from above. Through the window, we saw Na'el sitting by herself in the dark, in her room, beside the fireplace. Difference is, she was now holding the crystal in her hands. She recalled what the sound spoke,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Let us away... Towards a new world... Out with the old. And in once more, with the new.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was so engaged with the crystal she missed the sounds of objects drifting through the air. As the speech finished, she hadn't had time to think when it struck right in the middle of the City, exploded, and the flames lit up the room. "<strong>Ah!</strong>" She stood up, wondered what'd happened. "<strong>Ngh!</strong>" Ran out, and heard the emergency siren that signifies City under siege. Flames burning. Levnises roamed the streets. Folks running. "<strong>Oh, hu huh hrgggghhh!</strong>" Now where she'd lived the past 15 years will be wiped out except from distorted memories. Temporarily, she froze, unable to do anything, unable to know what to do, the crystal still holding in her hands.</p>
<hr />
<p>Z, in the cinema room, started speaking, "It has been over a decade since Alpha seized Origin. This eve he intends to show himself at last... <strong>While Origin remains</strong> in Alpha's <em>clutches</em>, my will cannot extend beyond its <em>threshold</em>... I trust you will <strong>set forth</strong> once more."</p>
<p>A bright light shone on N. He said nothing, gave a long pause, before teleported away, disappeared, bringing away the beam of spotlight with him.</p>
<p>"<em>Sword of the End...</em> That which denies <em>fate, and makes its essence mercurial... What machinations could have led it into that man's grasp...?</em>" After a pause, "Hmph. I see Origin <strong>brims</strong> with the very will... <strong>of those</strong> who are as <em>unto</em> <strong>gods</strong>..." And the Moebius sign in his Iris shone bright red. Then the light went off.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Na'el?! You're... I thought you were dead! <em>I'm so glad... I... I was so sure you'd... I thought I'd really lost you for good this time...</em>" No, when you're hijacked by emotions, no observations were made. Only when he took a look at her current status did he noticed, "<strong>Uhuhuh! What's up with that outfit, huh?</strong> Where'd you pick up a weird... getup like-" He started walking towards her.</p>
<p>Immediately, Rex shouted, "<strong>Matthew, no! It's not her!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh? Not- Na'el? But it clearly is! How can you not recognize her? <strong>OH, of course! You've never met her before!</strong> Hang on, I-I should have a photo..." Nonetheless, his steps were stopped after attention diverted. He reached for his pocket.</p>
<p>"<strong>Matthew! Look at me!</strong>" A sternly called for his attention. He stopped reaching for the photo. "The person you see before you isn't Na'el. It is in part, but not wholly. Inside of her... <strong>is Alpha!</strong>" Na'el had a thin smile on her face all the time they were interacting, spoke no word.</p>
<p>"<strong>HUH?</strong>" He cannot believed what she just spoke, teasingly hoped she's joking, "Not you too, A? <strong>What</strong> is this? Who is this- 'Alpha' guy anyway? <em>I don't understand...!</em>"</p>
<p>Na'el urged, "What are you doing? Come quickly. Everyone's waiting, Matthew." There should be no more convincing happening on their side.</p>
<p>Matthew as Matthew, his curiosity had to be satisfied, all things had to be cleared, before he pursue. Despite his strong urge to reunite, he begged, "Na'el, hold up a minute, yeah? Seems there's something really... confusing going on here..."</p>
<p>Shulk began to tell a story, "Alpha... suddenly appeared one day. With the goal of destroying this world." That was when the three of them were facing him in the bright luminescent space. "Rex and I, and Z too... We fought against Alpha. To save the world from his rancor. Alpha's power is unparalleled. <em>For all our efforts, it wasn't enough.</em> Even our collective might failed to repel him. In the end... All we managed was to buy a fraction more time." And the price paid? His right hand; <em>his</em> left eye.</p>
<p>A continued, "Having tasted frustration in battle, Alpha understood." She looked at the core crystal embedded to the suit, exactly like the one dangling on one of her ears, continued, "He realized... he needed something to amplify his power. An avatar."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>" And he turned his attention back to the glowing Na'el.</p>
<p>"Na'el is the avatar, Matthew."</p>
<p>"<em>Orgh...</em>"</p>
<p>"The day the City fell... You didn't... <em>lose</em> Na'el because she went missing. Rather... she had become Alpha's vessel." Na'el's eyes fixated on Matthew, waiting for his reply, ignoring the others.</p>
<p>Matthew denied their explanations, "No... Come on, A, not you too, I can't...! <strong>What the hell is this?! Can you stop making shit up?</strong>"</p>
<p>Rex shouted back, "<strong>There'll be time for explaining later! For now, you gotta give her a real drubbing!</strong>" Rex, Shulk, and A prepared their weapons.</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh? 'Drub-bing'?!</strong>" How dare you do this to Na'el, without explanation? She is my sister, <strong>my sister!</strong> And you want to hit her in front of her brother?</p>
<p>Shulk explained, "Not that violent. If at all possible, we will free Na'el."</p>
<p>"<strong>And if it's not?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Rex be the red face guy, "<strong>If it's not, then... Better buckle up, kid!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>YOU CAN'T BE BLOODY SERIOUS!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Na'el concluded, "Hrmph. You are in the way... of our vision."</p>
<p>"Na'el...?" What are you talking about? <em>Our</em> vision? What vision?</p>
<p>"Say... What's so great about this world, really? All the thieving for one's own <strong>gain! The greed! Life, has less value in this world than a PIECE of DIRT! THIS IS YOUR WORLD OF PEACE?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urmph..." "Ngh..." The bang it sent into the hearts of Nikol and Glimmer; who were more felt{{footnote: 感同身受}} than them soldiers living such life for the past 9 terms!</p>
<p>"<em>We don't need it... <strong>Do we</strong>, Matthew?</em> <strong>ANSWER!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Urgh!!!</em>" He don't know how to answer. Their difference in perspective now grew to such length that he no longer understand his sister. Therefore, he froze.</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>" She shook her head, "You disappoint me, truly." Should have known better. He always he. "I didn't think you'd side with <em>them</em>."</p>
<p>"<strong>I- HAVEN'T! I'M JUST...!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Enough of this. We will simply go alone, then." And she drew her blades. All those that hadn't drew their blades now drew it out, except Matthew.</p>
<p>"<strong>NA'EL!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>With sharp cuts, her stiff tone concluded, "<strong>Goodbye</strong>... my brother."</p>
<hr />
<p>More and more energy unleashed as shockwaves directed at the group. Imagine trying to walk in a strong wind without cover, your body heavily tilted  forward.</p>
<p>"<strong>Bastard...!</strong>" Rex couldn't believe it, "That's a helluva lot more power than before!"</p>
<p>A explained, "<strong>It's the avatar. Her emotions are heightened. They're feeding straight into Alpha's power.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>URGHHHH!!! Na-Na'el...! Hey... stop this!</strong>" She directed more focus on him as he tried to cut off,  "<strong>PLEASE, JUST STOOOOOPPPPP!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a purple beam descend the clouds from behind Matthew, ignored the shockwave effect, and sliced at Na'el. Such slice halt the expending energy waves. Dust and dirt splattered where Na'el stood.</p>
<p>"Huh?" The others were wondering what happened.</p>
<p>"Hrhhh..." Such annoying power, despite herself unhurt. The sound of teleportation appeared; Matthew turned to see who he is. "No... Not him?!" The haunting nightmarish guy, with dull eyes despair of all hopes, appeared. The memories of sword pierced into his grandad's stomach still lingers clear and bright.</p>
<p>"N!" A called out.</p>
<p>"If raw emotion <em>is what affords him strength,</em> it must be disrupted with emotion stronger still. You fail to reach such a <em>zenith. Alpha...</em>" Step by step, he took straight towards her, ignoring the others would-be allies, intending to take her down himself. "<em>I, N, shall thwart you once more. My blade will cut...</em>" and he put his hand on the grip, gathering the power of purple lights, "<strong>your very will!</strong>" And sliced so fast he's already in front of her before he finished his words. Alpha reacted just as quickly, blocked it with her blades. And they now fight one on one.</p>
<p>Rex was surprised, "<strong>Sword of the End?!</strong> He's gonna use it?!"</p>
<p>"Sure about that?" Alpha asked. "I am <em>Na'el</em>, you know."</p>
<p>"I am divorced of all that." The ringing reverberates the air particles, creating a high-pitch ringing like the ones in tinnitus, or the ones to repel mosquitoes, "All doubts... misgivings... <strong>Gone!</strong>" One that had lost all hopes cannot be hoped for. Round 2.</p>
<hr />
<p>His hands on the hilt; Matthew gritted his teeth as he shielded Na'el. He pulled anyways, brought both of them down. Matthew dragged to one direction, Na'el rolled on another. He looked at them without emotion, gently put his sword back into the scabbard.</p>
<p>"Urgh urggghhh... Na'... el..." He saw where she was, but his strength were gone too far to reach her.</p>
<p>With effetely crying tone, she pleaded, "<em>Help me...</em>"</p>
<p>This is his sister, this is his sister; and now she's crying for help. She never asked for; now that she asked, he had to!</p>
<p>"<em>Matthew...</em>"</p>
<p>N watched the performance with dull eyes. Tired of such performance, "This again, Alpha? Really...?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Na'el!</strong>" He pushed and pushed and pushed, dragged his uncontrolling body along the dirt, pushing with all the strength in his arms. Even if he cannot stand, he had to reach for her.</p>
<p>The ringing started again as N was bound to end it all. The Sword of the End reverberated the air, penetrated even into the fabric that made up the world. "<em>It is over...</em>" He therefore slashed it.</p>
<p>At very last, "<strong>No!</strong>" The will to protect is the will of the Ouroboros. "<strong>STOOOOPPPP!!!</strong>" He then regained his strength as the power of the Ouroboros came alive within him. Such energy capable even to stop N's attacks.</p>
<p>"Hurggghhh..." He dragged back as the force pushed him with. The soul of the Ouroboros leave a Dharma image{{footnote: 法相虚影。}} on the surface of his body. He now remembered, "It's you..."</p>
<p>Behind him, Alpha had a thin smile on her face. It had succeeded. He'd succeeded in evoking his emotions to their Grandad.</p>
<p>"<strong>Like killing Grandad wasn't enough for you... NOW NA'EL, TOO?!!</strong>" His Ouroboros power grew stronger and stronger with emotions. He then punched and make a great ball of energy flying towards N. He hadn't even blocked when A did so. "Huh? <strong>THE HELL YOU PLAYING AT, A? WHY?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"You must not lash out at him, Matthew! <strong>He's not your enemy, I promise you!</strong>"</p>
<p>Between the smokescreen, their voice were muted; but that didn't stop them from hearing (but not listening) to each other. "<strong>STOP TALKING SHITE!!! HE'S TRYING TO KILL NA'EL!!! HE KILLED GRANDAD!!! AND YOU'RE...!</strong>"</p>
<p>She stopped him, "He is... <strong>your flesh and blood!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Wha-?!"</p>
<p>A turned to look at him. OK, since he wanted to know, he reached for the button that remove his golden mask. The Moebius symbol first came online in his iris, but what shocked him the most, is his facial image, so similar to the ones he saw on the photo. The photo where he, <em>he</em>, sat beside the hospital bed, along with the woman whom was Grandad's mum! "<strong>HUHHH!!!</strong> Impossible... <strong>Can't be...!</strong>"</p>
<p>Alpha, still lying on the floor behind him, found an emotional weakness for him to manipulate, "Yet... It was this man who tried to erase me. <strong>He- is</strong> the one to blame!"</p>
<p>"Na'el..." He watched as she stood on her feet. Alpha looked into N's eyes, and he looked back.</p>
<p>Looking into his eyes, she noted, "They're strong, your emotions. Stronger <em>even</em>... than my own.{{footnote: Such emotions you had to watch Xenoblade 3 to understand.}} <em>Ungh.</em>" The rest of the group now became sidekicks.</p>
<p>Rex looked at Alpha's core, wonder why he would talked at such length, observed something that the people who're too indulged in their speech hadn't saw. His core was damaged; there was a slice on it, and particles escaped. Even Alpha's core can't bear the power of the Sword of the End, eh! She used her right hand to cover it thereafter. "Think you've bought yourself some time?"</p>
<p>N answered, "We may not have much, but it's more than we need to <strong>erase</strong> you."</p>
<p>"Quite. Well then, I'm happy to wait." Then, she turned to Matthew, "For you both, yes?" In a beam of light, leaving behind some particles, she teleported away, not waiting for their answer. She had to go and heal before her wounds reached unbearable length, before she became too weak to risk taken hostage, to risk being erased.</p>
<p>Matthew just felt sad. What happened? Reunions shouldn't be like this. Reunions should be such despairing. The stars still hung high in the sky; it had not been long, the battle, for the sun to rise. The rest of the day will be fill with explanations; for he want answers to what had been shielded from him throughout. Where's the trust? But before that, let's turn to a horn-like structure beyond the cliff-rocks that lurked visibly, reflected the light from the stars.</p>
<hr />
<p>On this structure{{footnote: If you'd watched Xenoblade 1, you'd know it's called 'prison island', the island that imprisoned Zanza.}}, the crystals on a semicircle arc on the only platform shone brightly. Then, electric balls started gathering on a larger arc in mid-air that reflected it. All chains of electricity independently shot high up into the air, creating a few beams of continuous lightning that brightly lit the sky.</p>
<p>At the very top of where the electricity delivered, a spiral started forming, reverberating energy to its surroundings. After the energy dimmed down, a circular disc feature, where each layer of its teeth turned anti to each other{{footnote: Meaning, if layer 1 turned clockwise, layer 2 will be anticlockwise, and layer 3 clockwise, and each layer are seen as a 'ring' around the arc you can view as.}} cancelled its invisible status and appeared in mid-air. Such airship was so huge that if it smashed down, the whole vicinity would be wiped out; Matthew and the others would be erased from history.</p>
<p>They watched as it slowly by slowly got closer and closer to land. But no, it stopped once it reached some height. Shulk was surprised, "<strong>Origin?!! What's it doing here?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Linka linked, "<strong>It must be Alpha's doing!</strong>"</p>
<p>Rex: "All it means, is that we don't have a whole lot of time to spare..."</p>
<p>Matthew was still lingering in his emotions; he still cannot forgive his great grandfather killing his grandpa. He clenched his teeth as N turned his attention back at him, watching him emotionlessly. A now came by his side, watching their interactions. He took a few steps forward, got closer to N, opened his mouth, "What..."</p>
<p>He already knew what he wanted to know, answered, even before he could spurt out the whole question, "Eternity..." Matthew bit his tongue.</p>
<p>"<strong>Sorry?</strong>"</p>
<p>"My due. In return for protecting this world... Z promised me eternity..." And he showed his Moebius symbol. "<strong>An eternal present in which to abide.</strong>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Z watched him with both eyes Moebius,turned him from the state in his picture to his current state (more older looking), and put him on a Y-shaped road, where he stood at the bottom of the Y, and faced 2 path beyond him to choose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Z? Is that the Moebius head honcho? <strong>What d'you even do with eternity?For starters, you Moebius're-</strong> <em>huh!</em>" Then he bit his tongue as he got reminded of something. In the picture, it wasn't just him; but him, the woman with silver hair and cat ears, and the baby. Particularly, the woman. "<em>Bastard...!</em>" He already understood. "<strong>That's the reason for this?</strong>"</p>
<p>N knew he understood, closed his eyes and turned around. He then looked up at the sky, at Origin, changed the subject. She is not what he would want to talk about to them. "I'm sure... you plan to <em>pursue</em> them... And yet, I will not let you reach them. Before you can interpose yourself..." He peered over his shoulder at Matthew. "I will cut Alpha down. You'd do well to remember that."</p>
<p>"You serious? Even Na'el? <strong>She's your flesh and blood too!</strong>" Shouldn't he had understood the moment he killed his son for eternity with her? Doesn't matter. He don't need him to understand. He therefore teleported away without leaving him an answer. But wasn't that the clearest answer given?</p>
<hr />
<p>The night changed day, and Origin can now be seen clearly floating up in the sky. Looking up at their camp, Matthew know he had no long time. Before he reach her, or before it crash down, he had to be there first. "<em>Ungh....</em>"</p>
<p>While the others were conversing at the camp, Shulk, Rex, and A approached him, with Shulk leading, "Matthew. Come on, let's go back to base and regroup. We'll tell you everything we know."</p>
<p>"Damn straight..." Can you feel being betrayed, being held back from speaking until the dam collapsed? White lie is a lie, no matter how 'white' it is. It does not feel better, not is it better, than a 'black' lie. "I'm done being kept in the dark. 'Bout time you let me into the club." His strong, unforgiving eyes looking at A. Why did she even knew these guys beforehand? And she never told him before?</p>
<p>A:  "Huh..." Shulk nodded. A turned back first to the campfire, followed by the rest.</p>

<p>Seated by a rectangular table at the command center, Shulk began, "Our{{footnote: Him and Rex's}} original worlds... used to be one and the same. It boasted almost <strong>unthinkable prosperity</strong>, and was home to <em>so</em> many people."</p>
<p>Rex continued, "That is, until one man's foolishness screwed it all up, splitting it into two separate places."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A scientist at a lab pressed a button on the computer. At the center of the computer was a bright light with the shape like a cross.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shulk: "One was the world of the Bionis, and the other, Alrest."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bionis was two giant titan, standing on vast, infinite sea, wielding their monado{ fighting against each other, finally Bionis pierced into Mechonis's heart. Alrest was giant bird-like creatures that flew/swim atop vast, infinite cloud sea, hosting buildings and refuge on its back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shulk: "These two divided worlds began to... evolve, independently of each other. They each... gave birth to new life."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Alrest, there was a floating bird carrying a submarine-like ship hanging below its belly, departing the port, towards unknown destiny. On another place, perhaps Bionis, there were giant, green luminiscent birds with sharp diamond-like orange flakes on their multiple tails{{footnote: If you'd watched Xenoblade 1, you'd know they're called 'telethia'}}, soaring the air, roaming the clouds. Below where the bird flew were lush green grass with roads spiraling up the hill. Tall pillar-like stones stretched high into the sky, providing refuge to the scorching sun. No one knows what live above the platform hosted by the pillars, for only those with flight capabilities can reach such heights. New life can he stone age humans, or machine-like people walking in a factory.{{footnote: Mechonis.}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rex: "Wasn't as peaceful as it sounds, though. You had your share of tyrannical empires... scrabbling over limited resources. But despite all that, thanks to generations of people fighting for the future, the worlds did eventually know harmony."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A thunder strike a bird as it falls, injured, in darkness. In the center of a Industrial revolutionized city, a beam stroke from high above, creating a ball of energy that engulfed the city. The king of Mechonis stood before his throne, speaking. A guy with strict face and short black hair{{footnote: Trinity Processor Logos}} holding onto a cube crystal. Unmanned Levnis-looking machines of dark green texture and golden joints and metallic surfaces scanned with their red laser-like eye, killing and destroying anything belonging to the flesh people. A blue-faced pointed chin guy that looked like mermaids, his gown covered the back of his head and opened up like a mouth engulfing his whole body, leaving only his face visible. Another guy with neck-long hair and some beard{{footnote: Dunban}} accompanied by a machine man, in a town, turning around and spoke to someone. Machine man conversing with non-machine man inside a hall; its walls made of glass, looking very high-tech like. And other people, other human, other teams, other groups, all had their happiness, sadness, surprises, and... Melia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shulk: "Sadly, it didn't last. The two worlds torn asunder... longed to be as they once were."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People on a market, the door was a broken arc hanging two lanterns, looking up at the evening sky. The other world were emerging and became more and more visible high up on the sky, as if collision wasn't the question anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shulk: "But they were... composed of opposing types of matter."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One ball of yellow, one ball of blue, attracted towards each other like magnets of opposing poles. Their collision created so bright a light, released so much energy, it lit up the whole universe in its vicinity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shulk: "Recombined, they would dissolve into light and cease to be."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a mountain, a ball of energy suddenly appeared and engulfed a hole in it. After it disappeared, rocks that didn't turn into dust were left floating mid-air, spiraling around the center of the explosion, before falling to the ground under gravity's pull.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shulk: "The annihilation events you see across Aionios... are miniature portents of this."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That ball of energy did not only engulf the mountains, but everywhere on Aionios, holes in ground became the new crevasse and pits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rex: "So we put our heads together, and built something that would let us escape destruction."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a blueprint, there was a giant ball, with labeling that draw lines to the margins displaying more specific designs of the object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rex: "We called it 'Origin'. A repository of data about everything, of memories, and souls."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On top of a high place, perhaps a tower's balcony, a women dressed in white gown with spiky, long ears looked into the sky where half of the dimmed disc, Origin, floated. On another side, a long-haired women equally stood on top of a tall building's balcony looking at the other half of Origin floating in the sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rex: "Even if the worlds were annihilated, this system would let us revive them."</p>
<p>Shulk: "And..."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a night, cloudy day, Origin lurked above the clouds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rex: "That thing in the sky is it."</p>
<p>Shulk: "At the heart of its workings... is the Trinity Processor core called Ontos. In other words, Alpha."</p>
<p>"But Alpha deemed our existence obsolete and wanted to erase us. We all fought, even Moebius. And it was a draw... No, I guess- we lost." The lost hand, the lost eye, were the price they paid. What did Alpha paid? Time, probably, but no limb lost or anything unrecoverable. "All we did, was delay the inevitable a smidge. <em>We couldn't cut it.</em>"</p>
<p>"Now Alpha's gathering power again, and getting ready to depart. In the heart of Origin called the Ark. Alongside new life... The lives... of City people gathered there,... which he plans to take to a new world."</p>
<p>He could sense they'd finished talking fast, raised his head and questioned, "Is that all of it then? We done? No more little secrets?"</p>
<p>Shulk took one small breathe before answering, "It's the unvarnished truth."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>" They waited for him to digest. "<em>Huhhhh....</em>"</p>
<p>Linka had a question, "But... why would he choose her in particular? There were so many in the City to choose from."</p>
<p>Rex explained, "She's got Agnian ancestry... In terms of hereditary traits, Core Crystals get dominance." That was the crystal in her chest. "My guess? Maybe it's 'cause he's got injured when we fought. Maybe she's got whatever he's lacking."</p>
<p>"There's more to it." As the only person whom were enchained in her and knew her better than all except Matthew, and the only person that knew Alpha almost better than almost anyone else, A had something to add. "Her emotions also factor into it. Or... That <strong>may</strong> in fact be the most crucial element of all."</p>
<p>"<em>Argh...</em>" He should've known, her wishes, spoken clearly to him; but he'd been ignoring for so long till now. And now it can't be taken back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Say... What's so great about this world, really? All the thieving for one's own gain! <strong>The greed! Life, has less value in this world than a PIECE OF DIRT! THIS IS YOUR WORLD OF PEACE?!</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"That..." A turned her attention to him, saw him shaking his head, "That wasn't my sister back there. Na'el is the kindest person I know. She looked after the City's children, and they loved her..." He still can't turn his head around, or rather, he don't want to believe it, given his optimistic personality. Plus, whom of us are willing to believe that people change, that our friend changes, when we can live in the confirmity of unchange?</p>
<p>"But that's just it," rebutted A. He turned to A, what does she had to say? "When a person loses that, what do they do?" Recall Chyra losing her life. "They change."</p>
<p>"Hrrrpphhhhh..."</p>
<p>"What she said last night... That's the way she <strong>truly</strong> felt. And, to Alpha... Those emotions are the <strong>perfect</strong> fodder. Right now, she's a <strong>great</strong> deal more indispensable to him than me."</p>
<p>"<em>Hrrrrph....</em>" Then he stood up, strong and unwavering, declared, "I'll find him. But I'm doing it for her. For Na'el. All this- saving the world stuff? That's something for you guys to sort out. <em>I'll buckle up, no problem.</em>"</p>
<p>Rex was glad, "Good to hear." Shulk nodded. "Then our goals align. Case you didn't <em>notice... we want the best for you too.</em>" Matthew nodded back, turned around, leaving the others for themselves.</p>
<hr />
<p>He stood looking to the floor having time for himself in a balcony where boxes were stacked together and waterfall fell behind him. When A found him, she started, "Knowing N is your family... Still up to it?" He didn't look at her first, tucked whatever he's holding into his pocket, not gonna let her see it.</p>
<p>"Family? He <strong>killed</strong> Grandad. He's no family of mine."</p>
<p>"I see. Then I won't stop you. <em>Though...</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>She was looking at the ground when she speak, "Listen to me. If you decide to hear his side of the story, be sure to heed his words." She then looked into his eyes, "Once you do, you can judge for yourself. I'll respect your choice."</p>
<p>"Mmm..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Night, they returned to the command center and found the others were still there, sitting or standing. Other City folks were standing farther away, chatting. A: "Apologies. Were you waiting long?"</p>
<p>"No. We were just about to start." replied Panacea. "<strong>Right</strong>, about our next course of action..." she and Linka were standing in front of the notice board, perhaps using it like whiteboard/blackboard.</p>
<p>Matthew don't understand, "What's there to discuss?" Isn't everything clear? If so, the actions were also clear, "We break into that Origin place, beat Alpha to a pulp, <strong>and get Na'el the hell out of there! End of!</strong>"</p>
<p>Rex already "Thought you might say that. It's <strong>pretty much what we had</strong> in mind too."</p>
<p>A added some details, "If we want to make our way to Origin, then our first port of call will <strong>have to be</strong> Prison Island.{{footnote: The place where Zanza was imprisoned.}}"</p>
<p>"Prison, Island? Where's that?" Matthew never heard of it before.</p>
<p>Shulk shared, "Prison Island lies at the northernmost tip of the Cent-Omnia Region, where we are now. Smack in the middle of the rugged terrain."</p>
<p>A continued, "From there, there is a way into Origin."</p>
<p>Linka added, "However, there's a problem."</p>
<p>"'Course there is." said Matthew, like I didn't know.</p>
<p>"The entrance to Prison Island is located on the side of a tower, and at <strong>considerable</strong> elevation. The survey team has looked into it, and concluded that it would be <strong>impossible</strong> to access from ground level. The City's Armories are all under repair, which takes the air route off the table."</p>
<p>"So we're shit out of luck... Isn't there, some other way?"</p>
<p>Panacea calmed, "Relax. There's a way all right. We can tweak the Ether Slide apparatus, for direct vertical ascent. <em>Should give us access</em> to the island's face."</p>
<p>Shulk excitedly changed its name, "At that point we should probably call it an 'Ether Lift', really! I'll take you through the steps necessary for the refurbishment later at the workshop."</p>
<p>Matthew impatiently replied, "OK, gotcha. So to start with, we'll need to get this- 'Ether Lift' thing ready for action. <strong>Well, no time like the present!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Matthew!"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em> What's up, Nikol?"</p>
<p>"Oh erm... It's uh..."</p>
<p>Glimmer just shook her head at his timidity, took over, "There's something we wanted to talk to you all about." And he nodded.</p>
<p>"Uh, that's sudden. You sure it can't wait?"</p>
<p>Nikol: "It's- of the utmost importance."</p>
<p>"Hmmm..." Shulk was curious too.</p>
<p>"Right you are, then." If they says so, he'll listen. He looked around and saw those people walking around, talking around, no secretive and privacy at all. "But this place makes me <em>anxious</em>. <strong>Shall we take this somewhere else?</strong>"</p>
<p>Nikol agreed, "OK, then... how about our tents?"</p>
<p>"Great!"</p>
<hr />
<p>At their tents, they gathered around the campfire, and Matthew started, "Right, so lemme get this straight... Nikol, you said you had something important. Speak to me." He glanced at Glimmer, whom nodded back to him, before starting.</p>
<p>"Uhm, well, so... Glimmer and I talked things over, about... what to do next." He paused for a while, waiting for them to absorb what he just said, then announced, "<strong>We're gonna fight too. We wanna stand shoulder to shoulder with you guys.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>WHOA!!!</strong>" That surprised Rex.</p>
<p>"Hm..." Shulk had his suspicions.</p>
<p>Matthew clarified, "What, so... you mean you're coming with us to Origin?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah, I mean, it's true that</strong> thanks to you... we don't have to fight any more, <strong>but</strong>... Still, Glimmer and I, we don't have much time left anyway. If we can... <em>We'd like to use it, for your benefit.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Wow...</em> Pretty kind of you."</p>
<p>Glimmer added, "And anyway, that uh, Alpha... or whatever his name is. If we don't take him down, then the whole world's in danger, right? If that's how things stand, then we can't act like it doesn't concern us. <em>So. we. figured...</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>You're. Not. Coming. With. Us.</strong>" Rex unwaveringly denied their requests.</p>
<p>"Wha-?... <strong>Why the spark not? You think we can't hold our own? We're proper soldiers. We can fight with the best of you, and we're ready for anything.</strong>"</p>
<p>That's not the issue. He shook his head and continued, "All right, listen up. You seem to think that being- 'ready' makes you Alpha's <strong>match</strong> or something. <strong>You couldn't be more wrong. In this fight, your readiness counts for ZILCH. What we need now is RAW POWER.</strong>"</p>
<p>Shulk added, "You could say that the Ouroboros power is a <em>prerequisite</em> for opposing Alpha. But in <em>you two</em>, it's only just been awakened. The amount you possess won't be enough to pose a meaningful <strong>threat</strong> to him."</p>
<p>"You, you can't know that before we try...!" Glimmer pushed for acceptance.</p>
<p>Rex immediately rebutted, "<em>Nah</em>, we can, and we do. <strong>As you are now</strong>, it doesn't matter <em>how much you want it</em>, Alpha will <strong>SWAT</strong> you down like flies. Just like he did us, last time."</p>
<p>"Ngh..." Nikol dropped his head, losing confidence.</p>
<p>Rex added, "And this time round, it'd be doing me no favors to try and look out for you while fighting... so ,be good, and just..."</p>
<p>"What if... What if we could, <strong>gain</strong>, the power?" Nikol questioned before he could finished his sentence.</p>
<p>"<em>What did you say?</em>"</p>
<p>"Riku's told me all about the Ouroboros Stone. How the device can serve to deploy and <strong>amplify</strong> Ouroboros power. <strong>But also</strong>, that there's- still- room- for <strong>improvement</strong>, and how it may have powers that we don't know about... <strong>If we could tease out those capabilities</strong>, <em>then our Ouroboros power</em> should <strong>also</strong> grow stronger...!"</p>
<p>Logically, Shulk agreed, "Hmm... It's... a possibility, for sure."</p>
<p>Rex was finding other excuses, "You're grasping now. <strong>It'll never work</strong>, not against Alpha."</p>
<p>Glimmer immediately rebutted, "<strong>OK, <em>that</em> you <em>can't</em> know without trying!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Rex got stronger urged inside him, spoke faster, "Kids, kids, look! I'm only saying this for your own good..."</p>
<p>"No, hang on, Rex. I agree with Glimmer." Matthew stopped him.</p>
<p>"<em>Not you too?!!</em>"</p>
<p>"I know I feel like crap, having to sit around on my arse, knowing there was something I could do to make a difference. And if my days on this world were numbered, <strong>I'd hate it even more</strong>... Besides, I've not known these two for long, but I feel like they're part of the gang now. When you offered to fight with us... I was proper floored, guys."</p>
<p>"Aw, Matthew!" Nikol felt grateful.</p>
<p>"Hmph." Not that Glimmer want to show her other side.</p>
<p>A be the judge, "There's a logic to both sides of this debate, but I don't think you'll reach a middle ground. So, what do we do?"</p>
<p>Shulk don't know. "Hm... A very good question."</p>
<p>Rex questioned the two, "You said you want to draw out more power. Any- actual, solid- proposals?"</p>
<p>Nikol, "<strong>W-well, Riku- said, he had an idea, and- that- he'd tell us, once he was ready with the preliminary steps.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>All right. Then</em>, I suppose we should talk to Riku first." And he turned away.</p>
<p>Glimmer voiced out loud, "What's his problem? Crappy attitude to take with someone saying they wanna help you."</p>
<p>Linka, whom was still in the scene, just laughed at it, "Ohh, you don't know the <strong>half</strong> of it." And she walked away, not giving her the chance to ask what half.</p>
<p>Only after a while she reacted, "Huh? What's that supposed to mean?"</p>
<p>Matthew: "Don't mind them. Let's just all go and see Riku."</p>
<p>"Sure!" agreed Nikol. And they walked away.</p>
<p>Shulk stayed back for a while, sighed, "<em>Oh, Rex...</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>They found Riku at some workstation place meddling with something. The Ouroboros Stone was connected to some wires to the box he was meddling with. Then, Nikol entered and called out, "Hey, Riku!"</p>
<p>He put down the work at hand and asked, "Why whole crowd come see Riku? Riku exasperate. Anyway, Riku is busy now with work on Ouroboros Stone. Please to come back later."</p>
<p>"That's- <strong>exactly</strong> what we wanted to talk to you about, actually. <strong>You said before</strong>, that it- could- be- powered up. Could- you, tell us more about it?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Friend should have led with that.</strong> In that case, have come at just right time. Please to bear with for moment." He turned back to tinker with the box while speaking, "Ur-form{{footnote: Original form}} of Ouroboros Stone was made by Queens of Keves, and Agnus many many yonks ago. But that form still imperfect, <strong>hence people</strong> who <strong>summon</strong> power of Ouroboros, fail to stand up to Moebius. <em>And so</em>, Queen of Keves was captured... With Queen of Agnus left alone, she slink into hiding place to escape beyond reach of Moebius. But <em>Riku hear</em> that perfectization of mechanism was <strong>close</strong> at hand." The Ouroboros Stone was activated, having splitted the top half of the 'egg shell' to reveal the inner identities for modifications.</p>
<p>"Hrrr..." Rex wasn't yet convinced by such stories.</p>
<p>Riku didn't heard his murmur. As he walked to his table and searched underneath it, he continued, "RIku capable of improve assembly proper by <em>self</em>, basing on scattered records <em>from time of construction. But that alone surely not do trick.</em> Thing needed is <em>probably</em>... <strong>'Trigger'</strong>."</p>
<p>"W-What do you mean by that?" asked Nikol.</p>
<p>He moved himself in front of him, concluded, "To make long story short, Riku give friends, this." He brought out a device from his pocket. It was like comms, but we don't know what usage it does yet.</p>
<p>"What are these?" asked Matthew.</p>
<p>He tucked it back into his pocket, "Microterminals, for connect Ouroboros Stone with Ouroboros power users. When use Ouroboros power while wearing terminal, biological data of user sent to Ouroboros Stone. <strong>Should allow</strong> Ouroboros Stone to further <strong>'grow'</strong> in turn." Nikol seemed to pick up something from the floor (???) before he stood back up to listen to him completing his explanation{{footnote: Probably the microterminal???}}. "And when Ouroboros Stone grow, thanks to microterminal, power of Nikol and Glimmer also get more powerful,... <em>in principle.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Oh, I get it! So they just</strong> have to train while wearing those wotsits, yeah?"</p>
<p>"It- not- quite- so simple. As Riku mention, for <strong>true</strong> <em>growth</em>, will need even bigger 'trigger'."</p>
<p>Glimmer was confused, "I don't think I get what you mean by that. <em>What're we actually supposed to do?</em>"</p>
<p>Riku gave her the 'meh' face, "If Riku knew, job of Riku would be <strong>easier</strong>. All Riku can tell, is that normal level of fighting will <strong>not</strong> be enough."</p>
<p>Nikol considered for a moment, adding, "I think I might've figured it out, actually." Others have their attention on him, he continued, "When we were fighting against that Consul called N, when he, had us cornered..." He turned around and faced Matthew, shared what he'd observed, "<strong>There was this distinct spike in Matthew's Ouroboros power!</strong> I'm thinking that must've been the '<strong>trigger</strong>' -- for Matthew, anyway."</p>
<p>"<strong>Oh! That's what you mean!</strong>" He remembered it all right, the power he suddenly had to stop N's attack on Na'el.</p>
<p>Linka summarized, "So we're saying that fighting against even stronger foes could be the catalyst?" He nodded back.</p>
<p>Making such connection, Matthew naïvely suggested, "<strong>Hell yeah! Then how about we get out there, and hunt all the big-game monsters we can clap eyes on!</strong>"</p>
<p>Shulk suggested otherwise, "No... I've got a better idea."</p>
<p>Rex sensed something, turned to him and shook his head, sigh, "<em>Oh, boy, here it comes.</em>"</p>
<p>Shulk ignored him, told Nikol and Glimmer, "We can be your opponents, your... 'even stronger foes'."</p>
<p>"Whhhuhhhh?!" Nikol's voice was trembling.</p>
<p>Glimmer: "<em>Uh, one sec... When you say 'we', do you mean...?</em>" She turned to Rex, whom agreed,</p>
<p>"Well, it wouldn't be fair if you ganged up on him, right? Can't have that. If you can <strong>beat us both</strong>, then we'll let you do whatever you like. <em>Simple enough, right?</em>"</p>
<p>Matthew was excited at the idea, "<strong>Nowwww we're talking! A battle against Shulk and Rex?</strong> Can't ask for better opponents than that!"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>" Glimmer wasn't so impressed.</p>
<p>Panacea tried to incite her pride, "What, are you gonna chicken out?"</p>
<p>"Uh in your dreams!"</p>
<p>Rex suggested, "Might not go down too well if we start a punch-up in the middle of the <strong>Colony</strong>. How about we, <strong>relocate</strong>?"</p>
<p>Shulk: "Hm... may I propose the area- <strong>behind</strong> the Colony, then?"</p>
<p>"Gotrock Oracle Ruins, eh? Sure, sounds fitting. <strong>Let's do it!</strong> No objections  from you two?"</p>
<p>Nikol: "Not from me!"</p>
<p>"Hmph. Suits me, just fine."</p>
<p>Matthew cheered for them, "<strong>Go on,</strong> Nikol, Glimmer. <strong>Really stick it to 'em!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Facing the blue sky at a ruins with only the paved tiles with a stair leading up to a platform; originally, it should be a building, but except for one of its pillars, the rest is either broken or only a small shards remained. Foliage climbed everywhere. Yet when they arrived, an orange bird with wide wings greeted them, apparently taken habitat of the ruins. Colony 9 was built on top of a lake; and the water body separated this place with the colony.</p>
<p>Shulk: "Seems- we've been beaten to the punch."</p>
<p>Matthew: "Ironic, considering it was punching we were after in the first place."</p>
<p>Rex: "I don't think that's how irony works, kid." Summoned his blade, he commented, "At least it'll be a nice punchy appetizer before the main <strong>dish!</strong>"</p>
<p>Glimmer: "If <em>this</em> is the appetizer, I don't see how we'll have room for the entrée..." Bro, this is already like, <em>hard</em> difficulty; will the next dish be <em>insane</em>?</p>
<p>Unleashing his mechanical arms, Nikol look no choice, "Well, still... There's no recourse!"</p>
<p>Shulk agreed, summoning his blade thereafter, "Indeed... That's the spirit, Nikol!"</p>
<p>Then the rest after Matthew called for battle, "Orrrrite! Forks at the ready, then! <strong>Grub's up!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>It was tough, but it relaxes the muscle a bit. Rex gave them a thumbs up, "OK, good job, team... I'm feeling <strong>nice and warm.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Shall we get to it?" asked Shulk.</p>
<p>"Uh let's."</p>
<p>"Urgh..." Not that they could escape now.</p>
<p>The group leave empty spaces below the stairs for the two partners. While still getting ready, Nikol asked, "Do you think we stand a chance?"</p>
<p>"Hey, you cut that out, <strong>right now!</strong>"</p>
<p>"S-sorry..."</p>
<p>"And anyway, the point here isn't <strong>winning</strong>, or losing, right?"</p>
<p>"Right... <em>It's all so we can send data to the Ouroboros Stone</em>. Still..." Glimmer turned to look at him, waiting for his next words. "<strong>If- we're doing this anyway, might as well put in a winning performance, no?</strong>" His eyes met hers, and they looked into each other for a while, passing unworded emotions and feelings.</p>
<p>With a grim, she summoned her blade and turned back looking at the duo, cheerily agreed, "<strong>Heheh... Obviously!</strong>" And Nikol called his thereafter.</p>
<p>On the other side, Rex was commenting when Shulk was massaging his mechanical arm, "<strong>Pretty audacious wager</strong>. Especially for <em>you</em>, Shulk."</p>
<p>"I thought it would be the <strong>best way to get everyone on the same page.</strong>"</p>
<p>"It probably was, at that. <strong>Either way</strong>, it's time to put an end to this <strong>pipe</strong>-dream of theirs, of <strong>fighting against Alpha. They've got their potential</strong>, sure, but they're <strong>far from ready</strong>. That goes for <strong>Glimmer and Nikol both.</strong> If someone needs to burst their bubble, <strong>let it be us.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Yes, absolutely. We owe it to them, as- the adults in the room." And the battle begins.</p>
<p>Seeing them summon their blades, Nikol gave instruction, "I'll take the vanguard. Glimmer, support me from the rear."</p>
<p>"Roger that, Nikol. Let's do this."</p>
<hr />
<p>Both duos drifted backwards with force. Shulk's duo immediately stood up and resummoned their blades, and Glimmer's duo resummoned shortly thereafter. Shulk suggested, "Let's make this the decider."</p>
<p>"Yeah." And they both prepared for their strongest moves.</p>
<p>"Brace!" warned Glimmer.</p>
<p>"J-just a little more...! We <strong>need to ride it out...!</strong>" As their will to rebel got stronger, their microterminals, located by a bag strapped to her knees, in his pocket, started vibrating furiously. The Ouroboros symbol started appearing in their irises, while Glimmer glowed red, and Qi evaporating off her; similarly for Nikol.</p>
<p>A saw it, announced, "<strong>That's it!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>HAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!</strong>" Both pairs went for each other, their final blow. The impact point released an energy so huge it blew up the place, brightened the sky. Dimmed out, Shulk was half-knelt on the ground, Rex sat down. Nikol and Glimmer were still standing, and their Ouroboros power died down soon. Blue and red motes, seemingly the remaining expression of the power of Ouroboros, decorated the surroundings.</p>
<p>Glimmer:  "Did... Did we win...?"</p>
<p>Nikol stood straight, wanted to answer but was disturbed by the strong vibration he previously ignored from a lack of attention. Taking it out, he excitedly called, "<strong>Glimmer, look! Our terminals!</strong>" The two fluorescent-looking bars encased within the 'screen' glowed brightly, still vibrating furiously.</p>
<p>"We did it?" Then it dimmed down. They weren't sure what to make of.</p>
<hr />
<p>The audiences were excited as well. Matthew shouted, "<strong>WHOA, A! DID YOU SEE THAT?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Yes. Their Ouroboros power levels <strong>spiked</strong> to <strong>unprecedented</strong> heights."</p>
<p>On the ground, Rex exclaimed, "<strong>Not too shabby, are they?</strong>"</p>
<p>Shulk shook his head, "And it's not as if we went easy on them, either..."</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah</em>, feels like they whopped us, <strong>fair and square.</strong>"</p>
<p>"A <strong>fortuitous miscalculation</strong> on our part... <em>shall we say?</em>" The final attempt to save their own face.</p>
<p>"<strong>Heh!</strong> So much for us playing the big folks' authority card." They get onto their feet and went over to them. Glimmer and Nikol turned their attention.</p>
<p>"E-erm... You guys are OK, right?" Then she looked away, was feeling a little <em>guilty</em>...</p>
<p>Rex became playful, sounding effetely, "<em>Not too sure about that... <strong>Think I heard a rib crack earlier</strong>...</em>"</p>
<p>Glimmer immediately jumped on her feet, "<strong>Wha-?! No way! Let me see it I can splint it until we can get you proper care...!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Heh heh..." The grim on his face as he raised. Shulk just shook his head. Glimmer took a while to realize it was a joke.</p>
<p>"Ugh, asshole. You scared me! Don't even joke about things like that!"</p>
<p>"Ahahahahaha!" Glimmer then gave Nikol <em>the</em> look on the face. He saw it, and turned back, muted his laugh but not his smile.</p>
<p>The audience now approached them, with Matthew talking, "<strong>Good effort, team! Well impressed</strong> by what I saw out here today."</p>
<p>A: "Yes, the fight should have been more than enough of a trigger for the Ouroboros Stone."</p>
<p>"Mm... Let's go back to Riku's place and make sure of that."</p>
<hr />
<p>"Nikol, Glimmer. Good jobbings! <strong>Please</strong> to direct eyes hither." Turning to the Ouroboros Stone, it was shimmering like in an excited state. Green motes of Ouroboros power rising up but not escaping the constraint of the Ouroboros Stone.</p>
<p>Nikol noted, "The Ouroboros Stone is glowing!"</p>
<p>Riku explained, "While it receive biological data from friends, suddenly internal photon energy begin to exhibit signs of excitation. Without trace of error, Ouroboros Stone undergo <strong>growth</strong>, and power-up greatly."</p>
<p>Glimmer wants to know more about, "So does that mean <strong>our</strong> Ouroboros power grew as well?!"</p>
<p>"Glimmer and Nikol linked to Ouroboros Stone via terminal, <strong>also</strong> should be powered-up, <strong>yes</strong>."</p>
<p>Matthew agreed, "Yeah, well, there ain't much room for doubt after that little performance!" Then looking at Shulk and Rex, "You did beat these two fine <strong>strapping</strong> fellas."</p>
<p>Shulk: "Neither I nor Rex held back in our contest. There's no mistaking it -- the two of them bested us under their own power. I take back what I said. As you are now, you're more than fit to contend with the likes of Alpha."</p>
<p>He was excited, "<strong>Th-thank you, so much!</strong>"</p>
<p>And she gave him a smirk face, "And what have you got to say?"</p>
<p>He unfolded his arm and agreed, "What I said <strong>before</strong>. You beat us, so you can do <strong>what you like</strong>."</p>
<p>"Sooooo... I guess that means <em>you... recognize our</em> worth then, yeah?"</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah, I do.</em> You did good, kid. Really."</p>
<p>"Urrrrrr... Sure. <em>Whatever.</em>" She looked away, face red, but got the recognition she needed.</p>
<p>Shulk: "Well... I'm glad <strong>everything</strong> worked out."{{footnote: That refers to the situation, or refers to the situation between their parenthood, maybe both!}} A didn't said anything as she watched their interactions, deep in thoughts.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the group gathered around the Ouroboros Stone and chatted, the 'older' guys and gals (Shulk, Rex, A) waited outside the tent{{footnote: Actually, seeing the surrounding now, one realized this is Dunban's house. Looks like Riku had also moved not just his workshop there, but also the lab there.}}. She started speaking, "To protect their child, a parent is expected at times to set some <strong>firm</strong>, ground rules. I thought that's what you were doing."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ohhhh</strong>, I was <em>trying</em> to be firm, believe you me." Rex excitedly answered, "But it looks like they had the strength to <em>bend those rules</em>... <strong>What can you do, eh?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Heh...</em>" Shulk had equally no idea.</p>
<p>"Something funny?"</p>
<p>"Oh, not at all. It just occurred to me. I didn't expect I'd ever get to celebrate seeing them grow again like this..." He and Rex looked at Nikol encouraging Glimmer, conversing in the meantime. They watched her shook her head, declining his suggestion, whatever that is.</p>
<p>"Hmph. <em>You and me both.</em>"</p>
<p>A had another worry, "Even if we defeat Alpha, it won't <strong>change</strong> what fate has in store for them. When the time comes, what will <strong>you</strong> do?"</p>
<p>Without adieu, Rex blurted, "We'll change it. <strong>'Fate'</strong>, or... <strong>what have you.</strong>" A looked at him, he continued, "It's a weird and twisted world out there, sure, but you know... I can't watch a kid go before their parent. <strong>I'm not letting that happen, no way.</strong>"</p>
<p>Shulk agreed with him, "<em>I'll do anything that's in my power too...</em> Even if it costs us our lives." Rex kept quiet, agreed.</p>
<p>A guessed something, "Don't tell me..." Only their firm eyes and belief showed her their choice. She looked away, looked back at the kids having fun.</p>
<hr />
<p>{{footnote: We add something here on repairing the armories. <a href="./95_armories.html">Check them out in the appendices!</a>}}</p>
<p>Gathered around the table at the Command Center, Matthew concluded, "So, I guess we should be able to reach Prison Island now."</p>
<p>Rex concluded, "All that's left is to <strong>make sure</strong> all our preparations are in order for the big day."</p>
<p>Glimmer suggested, "Let's get plenty of rest in, ensure we're in optimal form for it."</p>
<p>Matthew agreed, "Sure. Once we're feeling ready, let's rest up in our tents."</p>
<hr />
<p>Gathered around the fireplace at their tent, night falls and Matthew concluded, "All right, I think we're as ready for tomorrow as we'll ever be. Might wanna hit the <strong>sack</strong> sometime soon."</p>
<p>A: "I'll be going straight to bed. Mind you don't oversleep, Matthew."</p>
<p>"<strong>I wouldn't! Don't patronize me, dammit!</strong>" The group just smiled at their jokes at each other.</p>
<p>Shulk shard, "Rex and I have some last-minute i's to dot at the command center. <strong>We have to ensure things run smoothly</strong> in our absence."</p>
<p>Rex started shaking his head, "<strong>Titan's foot!</strong> More paperwork? <em>Awesome, can't wait...</em>"</p>
<p>Panacea offered, "I'll help you."</p>
<p>Similarly for Linka, "I'll gladly lend a hand as well, Boss. Better for you to be on top form when you head out."</p>
<p>Matthew whom overheard their decisions concluded, "<strong>Right!</strong> Then I guess we're going our separate ways for tonight. <strong>See you bright and early tomorrow!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>The moon hung huge up in the sky, the town went quiet blanketed by the stars. He looked at plans laid out on the table alone, with merely an ether lamp providing barely sufficient illumination. She stood outside and watched him, didn't dare yet to enter. He bent over and laid his hands on the table, attentively focusing on the paperwork while reaching out for the cup with his trembling left hand, feeling his way.</p>
<p>"Urgh..." Just before the cup toppled, her hands reached and held it in her hands. "<em>Kiddo... Cheers.</em>" He took the cup from her hand.</p>
<p>"<em>I'm not 'kiddo'...</em>"</p>
<p>"Ahh, <em>gotcha</em>. Glimmer, I know. <strong>You need</strong> something <em>from me? Someone erm... asked you to deliver a message, or</em>...?"</p>
<p>"Thank you." Her eyes can't laid on his, too shy to admit.</p>
<p>"<em>Umm?</em>"</p>
<p>"I-I never... got a chance <em>to thank you.</em>"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"For saving me, <em>that is.</em>"</p>
<p>"Ohhh... <em>It wasn't that big a deal.</em> All in a day's work." says he as he faced back to his paperwork, or rather, away from her. "<strong>Sorry</strong> for flipping out <em>at you.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Ohng...</em>" She dropped her head, unsure what to react. "<strong>Spark you, how dare you!</strong> huh... <em>That was my first thought.</em> But now, I'm glad I'm here... Glad I can choose for myself..." His eyes on hers, listening to her attentively than superficially.</p>
<p>"That right." The pause was a little long as topic rushed through their brains, searching for a commonality. Wind brushed through the tips of her waist-long hair as it wiggled vigorously. She started the conversation back again.</p>
<p>"Say..."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"Your scar. <em>That recent?</em> <strong><em>What's the story?</em></strong>{{footnote: This is useful not only in <em>the</em> story, but real life too. People just like to tell stories, and if you can show curiosity at them, and one mean <em>real</em> curiosity, not <em>fake</em>, and you know what's <em>fake</em> if you sense <em>not genuine</em>... If you cannot sense, read more books about it and learn how to!}}"</p>
<p>"<strong>Oh this?</strong>" The scar permanently damaged his left eye. "Lost it in the fight with Alpha. Got sloppy and had to pay for it."</p>
<p>"Huh!... I'm sorry..."</p>
<p>"It's got its downsides... <em>but I kinda like it. This guy I really looked up to? Had an eye thing too.</em>"{{footnote: One can't remember whom he's referring to.}}</p>
<p>"Like a mentor? Sounds nice..." And she dropped her head, perhaps wishing she'd a mentor too; or perhaps, there was something she need to voice out but she needed some time to muster the courage, "<strong>Hey, why do you do all this?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Why do I do all... <em>what now?</em>"</p>
<p>"All the helping. <em>It's nothing to do with you,</em> but you risk your life and limb, fighting to protect people <em>you don't even know...</em>"</p>
<p>He turned to another side, his memories came upfront, answering, "<strong>Smiles</strong>, <em>I guess...</em>"</p>
<p>"Ungh... Smiles?"</p>
<p>"<em>If through my fighting, someone out there gets to smile... That's the kind of world I wanna help</em> create."</p>
<p>"And that's why you fight?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. <em>And also...</em>" He looked back at her.</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"You're a little off. <em>It's not 'nothing' to do with me.</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>"<strong><em>Long as you're alive... you're always connected to others.</em></strong> <em>We used to call it affinity or bonds.</em>"</p>
<p>"'Bonds'...?"</p>
<p>"Our meeting was the <em>work of chance.</em>" He looked down at her chest, the core crystal that signified Pneuma's, and continued, "<strong>Chance</strong>. That's what tied the bond between you and me. And now... We gotta <strong>protect</strong> that."</p>
<p>"Well, spark..."</p>
<p>"<em>Protecting the world, see... It's just that simple</em>." What words continued thereafter, we no longer knows. But certainly something more interesting than paperworks!</p>

<p>Next morning, Shulk and Rex joined the others whom had assembled. Rex then shouted out, "<strong>RIGHT! Is that everyone?</strong>"</p>
<p>Nikol, checklist in head, scanned around, reported, "Um... We're missing Matthew." They were gathering by a protruded platform that overlooked the body of water below, the waterfall to the left of him.</p>
<p>Shulk: "That's worrying... Has something happened?" Shulk and Rex looked at each other.</p>
<p>Just then, there was a great shout from the other direction, "<strong>OOOORRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH, DAMMIT!!! I OVERSLEPT!!!</strong>" After he jumped in, he huffed and puffed, "Huhhh... Huhhhhh... Sorry you guys! Sorry I'm late!"</p>
<p>A shook her head, "I <strong>cannot</strong> believe you <strong>actually</strong> overslept."</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah I dunno what happened. Just couldn't settle down.</strong> I was tossing and turning like crazy..."</p>
<p>Even Rex shook his, "<strong>Awww</strong>, diddums..."</p>
<p>Glimmer: "Gee, someone's got a sensitive constitution..."</p>
<p>Nikol can't believe what he heard, "Matthew, sensitive...?"</p>
<p>He had a target now, peered at him, "<strong>You wanna</strong> share your observations with the rest of the class, Nikol?"</p>
<p>He swiftly turned away, "Oh, n-n-nope! <em>Nothing to add at this point!</em>"</p>
<p>Panacea effetely sighed, "<em>I worry about the future</em> sometimes... <strong>I'll... move us right along, shall I?</strong> Let's talk about the route to Prison Island." She then turned to look behind the waterfall. There was a large cave entrance that connected to the body of water. The thinness of the waterfall cannot veil such entrance. "You see <strong>that</strong>, out the back of Colony 9?"</p>
<p>Glimmer asked, "Is that a... cave?"</p>
<p>"That's right. That's the first waypoint."</p>
<p>Linka continued, "There's a large pit beyond the cave, which would be difficult to scale by hand. Fortunately..."</p>
<p>Matthew filled in the blanks{{footnote: Not a good style talking actually, sometimes, it feels disrespectful.}}, "<strong>We've got the Ether Lift, right? One step ahead of ya.</strong>"</p>
<p>"As you said. It'll be <strong>perfect</strong> for a field test."</p>
<p>Shulk asked, "Panacea, have you got what we spoke of?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Teacher! And- not a moment too soon!" She took from her pocket and handed out 1 Trial Black Crystal, 3 Monochromagnetite, and 2 Ether Cylinder.</p>
<p>"Thanks for your hard work. Just what the Ether Lift needed."</p>
<p>Matthew crunched his palm against fist together, as if preparing to fight, "It's time to take Alpha down a notch, <strong>and bring Na'el home! For better or worse</strong>, <em>it's nearly over</em>. <strong>First</strong>, Prison Island. <em>And then, Origin!</em> <strong>Strap in, everyone! It'll be the riiiide of a lifetime!</strong>" The rest nodded and agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Creatures with flames on their body and legs, reindeer-like or wolf-like or bird-like or whatever the shape is, plus some Tauros with reindeer-like long branchy horns, and other animals such as the white birds with blue tips on their ultra-long wings, roamed the icy mountains. The land were steep, covered in thick snow. The rocks were dark, acting as foundation for the whole mountain. An arc like the ones in Triomphe, half buried in snow; perhaps ancient civilization used to live here, as other remains still stood strong like Rome's Colosseum today, but such palace-like city were now abandoned. Strong winds blow, orange thunder stroke. At the very top of Prison Island, stairs lead up to an altar-like platform, and at its end, a fan-like object stretched open 180°; the place of imprisonment. This, is the <strong>Black Mountains.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>On the Mountain itself, standing atop snow, there was an Ether Slide built behind them{{footnote: Yes, a slide, not a lift, because it's not going straight up.}}, they were conversing.</p>
<p>Glimmer exclaimed, "I cannot believe you! That day was the first time the two of you ever met, and you just 'assumed' A was from the City?"</p>
<p>"There was a lot of us. <strong>I didn't know</strong> every single person... A had supposedly lived there, and just happened to be coming back. That's basically when our paths crossed."</p>
<p>"So you knew nothing at all about A, but you tagged along anyway? <em>Ugh... Nobody's that oblivious.</em>" A was turning her head left and right, overhearing the 'dire' conversations about her between them.</p>
<p>"<strong>Hey, blame the one keeping the secrets, not me.</strong>"</p>
<p>Now she had something to say, the ball passed to her, "You never thought to <em>inquire</em> about it, so I never told. That's all..."</p>
<p>"Huh? <strong>Don't give me that!</strong>"</p>
<p>"I mean, traveling this world alone isn't exactly normal behavior. Normally you'd inquire!"</p>
<p>His eyes wide opened, refused to acknowledge, "<strong>No you wouldn't!</strong> Normally." He couldn't continue the sentence.</p>
<hr />
<p>They built a campfire where wind won't blow too hard, shielded by the tall cliff walls. Riku was maintaining an object wrapped mummy-like, its tip on the snow and balanced upright on the table, together with Shulk's Monado. The pot was cooking to his right. Linka sat next to the pot, listening to Panacea. Nikol was meddling with the duffel bags. Rex talking to Glimmer, Matthew checking his terminal. Shulk and A looked at the various activities the others were doing.</p>
<p>Shulk turned his attention to "A..."</p>
<p>"Go on."</p>
<p>"When I turned down the chance to be a god, I lost the power to have visions. But you, A..."</p>
<p>She didn't wait for him to finish, "There is no single established future. You should know that better than anyone, Shulk."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>"</p>
<p>"If I were to tell you now, what form your futures might one day take, it would be but one possibility, and a hazy one, at that. The thing that gives 'shape' to the future... it is your <strong>will</strong>. That's all the future is, Shulk."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh!</em> You're quite right. I don't relish getting old. Age saps my courage." He shook his head.</p>
<p>"That perfectly correct." Someone had been eavesdropping on them for long. He walked up to him, complaining in a stern voice, "Leaping Blade-first into thick of fray... is game best left to young and reckless."</p>
<p>"You said it, Riku."</p>
<p>"Actually, it's Masterpon who say."</p>
<p>"Your master, eh?"</p>
<p>"Masterpon say... when find one such give this." He turned to look at the mummy-wrapped blade. Yet, despite the wrappings, he seemed to recognize,</p>
<p>"Isn't that...?"</p>
<p>"Everyone... is right here." And he turned to his Monado, continued, "And also with Shulk... there."</p>
<p>He looked at his own blade, perhaps enlightened, "You're right. We're not alone."</p>
<p>A thin smile on Riku's face, his head nodded, "Hmph!" He turned back to A, and she gave him a thin nod.</p>
<hr />
<p>What was the mummy-wrapped object then? Let's look at another conversation back at colony 9, Riku's workshop. Matthew was looking at it when Riku called out, "It catch eye of friend?" He turned and saw him walking up to beside him.</p>
<p>"Huh? Um, yeah, gotta admit it has."</p>
<p>"Then Riku relieve curiosity, just this once. As special reward for services rendered."</p>
<p>Opening it up, it was a sword of purple dark hilt, connected to the shiny blade via a circle with a hole built into the 'Ricasso' of the blade. Its sharpness capable of slicing through steel like tofu.</p>
<p>"Whoa... That's a wicked-looking blade. Even I can tell it's a masterwork, and I don't know the first thing about swords."</p>
<p>"Yes, it just as friend say. It impossible to conceal. Sword is special weapon, forged from metal of Origin origin."</p>
<p>"Wha-! like, <em>Origin</em> origin?"</p>
<p>"It said that Origin is place where memories and souls of people are gathered. That go also for this sword, forged from Origin metal as it be. According to Masterpon, dearly important people reside inside."</p>
<p>"Important people? In a sword?"</p>
<p>"Masterpon has said to Riku, many many yonks past..." and he looked up to recall the storyline. "One day will come when Riku must give sword to person who is worthy."</p>
<p>"So this Masterpon of yours made a sword from Origin bits? Who the heck could've done a thing like that? A Nopon, I bet, right?"</p>
<p>"Meh meh? What friend saying? Masterpon of Riku was friend Melly. Did Riku not say?"</p>
<p>"Melly? Who's that?" He thought for a while, running through the list of people in his head, until he reached one, "No way... You can't seriously mean... Melia, the Queen of Keves?!"</p>
<p>"Exacting. Like Riku say, Melly. Dadapon of Riku and Melly once traveling companions...{{footnote: Heropon Riki}} Eh, but it long story, so Riku rather not tell."</p>
<p>"Sounds like you're kind of a big deal then, huh?"</p>
<p>"Please not to spread this story around. Riku not fan of celebrity namedropping."</p>
<p>"Right I see... Yeah, sure, you got it." Then he changed the subject back to the sword, "Say, Riku, does the sword have a name?"</p>
<p>"Of course. Name of sword is... 'Lucky Seven'!" And he did a dab.</p>
<p>"Lucky... Seven...?"{{footnote: The Lucky Seven whom traveled together by pure chance during his Dadapon and Melly period, perhaps.}}</p>
<p>"What friend think? Cool, no? Terrific? Perhaps magnificent, even?" The demand for praise and respect!</p>
<p>"Hmmm..." He thought for a while before answering, "Pretty decent."</p>
<p>Riku shockingly cried, "<strong>For serious?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Sure, yeah. It's got a nice ring into it. I like it, personally."</p>
<p>"Meh meh! Friend Matthew is first who say so!"</p>
<p>"Lucky Seven, huh..." He looked back at the sword, "Hope you get to meet your worthy new master some day. Fingers crossed, eh?"</p>
<hr />
<p>The group continued on their journey up the snowy mountains; some ice had formed so thick it's grew into 5-storey tall crystals. The red lightning never stopped striking at this height afar.</p>
<p>Matthew got the chance to ask, "Say, A. I'm not sure... <strong>how</strong> much I should trust you, right now. So talk to me." She didn't answer anything, continued walking on. He pressed on, "What really happened back then? In the City? If you're a part of Alpha, then you must've seen it, right? <em>What do you know?</em>"</p>
<p>She stopped right there, but firm in her voice, "I won't tell you."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"That's... <strong>something</strong> I'm afraid you'll have to ask N about directly."</p>
<p>"<strong>I should?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Then you must judge for yourself. What to do afterwards." She turned around and look into his eyes, "Whom it is that you should save."</p>
<p>"<em>Hrrr...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Beyond the answers you seek, you'll find Na'el.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Hrrr...</em>" His voice more shaky and nervous, "<em>Huhhhh...</em>" No other choice, then. "Is uh..."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"Is A your real name?"</p>
<p>She looked up in the sky, "It has the nuance of, 'the one at the beginning'. <em>In this world, only I and Alpha can claim that honor...</em>" Where she looked, and where Matthew followed glance, was where the Origin floated, their destination.</p>
<hr />
<p>Origin lurking high up above them; and they were at the top of Prison Island. The group reached a platform where imprisonment happened, and there, the final teleportation device laid. Looking at it, there's no turning back.</p>
<p>Shulk noted, "It might not be the best way to put this, but... It's like old times."</p>
<p>A recalled: "In the past, you embarked for Ontos's memory space from here. Recreating it... was <strong>deliberate</strong> on Alpha's part."</p>
<p>"You mean, we'll be able to board the Ark from here."</p>
<p>"Logically it would follow, yes."</p>
<p>"Hmm!" They then looked up at the sky, their final destination. Suddenly, there were purple motes floating around, gathering in front of them while a high-pitch reverberating tone muted their ears, "<strong>THAT'S N!!!</strong>" He appeared in front of them, facing them.</p>
<p>Rex: "<strong>So he decided to wait for us after all. What a considerate lad.</strong>" The group let down their guards.</p>
<p>"Hrrrh!" Glimmer wasn't feeling good seeing that pair of dimmed irises, her voice shaky.</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked Nikol, standing close beside her.</p>
<p>"I've never seen a Consul like that before."</p>
<p>"I guess... <em>that's 'cause</em> he's one of ours?"</p>
<p>She turned to him, "I know <em>that</em>. It's the look in his eyes. Did you see?"</p>
<p>"Whuh?"</p>
<p>"The other Consuls... <em>In theirs, there's joy. This gleeful glint...</em> But for him... His hold no light at all." Nikol's eyes widened, just noticed. "<em>I-I don't like it... Not one bit.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Mmm...</em>"</p>
<p>"Tch..." Matthew took the initiative to walk towards his great grandad. "You tryna bar our way? <strong>That's the vibe I'm</strong> gettin' here."</p>
<p>"You're aware... Alpha said he was <strong>waiting</strong> for you."</p>
<p>"Yeah and so what?"</p>
<p>"<em>What that implies,</em> is that he <strong>requires</strong> your presence. That without <strong>you</strong>, the <strong>Ark</strong> will not <em>depart</em>."</p>
<p>"<strong>Come on, stop beating around</strong> the bush, dammit. <strong>It's pissing me off!</strong>"</p>
<p>"I'm saying the one keeping Na'el in this world is <strong>you</strong> and none other."</p>
<p>Rex concluded, "And that's why you're trying to kill <strong>Matthew</strong>, is that it? No thought for saving Na'el or anything? <em>Man</em>. Twisted- little- so-and-so..."</p>
<p>"You serious about this?" asked Matthew.</p>
<p>"<em>I did warn you.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Ohh, gee thanks.</strong>"</p>
<p>"In the current of the eternal flow,... you need not justify the means. <strong>All</strong>, is swallowed up. Everything." And he prepared to slash at him. The groups therefore drew their blades and faced him.</p>
<p>"Ungh." No other choice.</p>
<hr />
<p>"<strong>TRRRRRRHHHHHHHHH!!!</strong>" Matthew is battling with N's sword. A dashed to the flanks and joined the fight, activating his sword's elevated form with its symbol. "Huuuuuh!" "Trrrrr!"</p>
<p>He pushed them backwards with a horizontal slash, releasing huge amount of energy, dashed forward and knocked Linka and probably Panacea to the side, broke Nikol's shielding arms, fenced him until he almost lose his defense, but Shulk got in front of him while they were battling. "<strong>HUUUUURRRRAAAHHHH!!!</strong>" Nikol tried to hold him back, but Shulk was now enraged, attacking N with all his might.</p>
<p>Sensing someone coming, he put up his mechanical arm where Glimmer jumped "<strong>HRRRRRAAHHHH!!!</strong>" towards N. Rex joined beside her, and together, they went for him, still halfway in the air.</p>
<p>"You will go... <strong>no further!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Idiot!!!</strong>" Matthew had summoned the Ouroboros power as he dashed towards where he expected him to land. "<strong>See some bloody sense, man!</strong>" The Ouroboros power is so enhanced it punched right through him and through his back, and reached straight up at Origin.</p>
<p>"Huh!" Linka and Panacea saw the changes in Origin as it absorbed the power of the Ouroboros, "What...? What's that light?!"</p>
<p>A: "Could it be... " Before she could voiced her guesses, the energy shot back down at the platform, and what they see now changed.</p>

<p>Grandad was leisurely returning home along a grassy path one night, when he stopped and saw something off in the distance. "Hmm?" What is it that was off, he asked himself. Then, the floor shook, a mushroom flaming clouds behind the cliff brightened the sky. Quickly, he dashed along the rights of way, hoping his return would not be too late. The familiar path did not require his eyes; his eyes fixated on the continuous explosion. Something was off, something... that don't look like an explosion. "What's that... strange pillar of light...?" An orange beam straight up into the sky. No time to guess, he'll know when he get back to the City.</p>
<p>Fallen fragments and burning rubble, he had to make it to the center, the pillar of light guide his way. Only frequent explosions in his rights of way slowed him down, till one last stop and he found out. Within the giant pillar of light, the of the City stood emotionless within, indifferent to their home getting destroyed. Na'el, standing on the front row, heard his footsteps getting near, tilted her head; the others robotically followed in sync with her actions. Grandad saw her opened her arms, walking out of the beam, enchantingly said, "Come. Enter the circle, quickly. It's just you and Matthew now."</p>
<p>"Na'el? What're you...?" An explosion shook him out of focus and balance; he hadn't made sense of what had happened to them yet. "Hmm?" Looked around, secondary spider-like Moebius marched towards the beam, led by N. "Huh!" Without mask, Grandad easily recognized the one he'd not seen for eons. With trembling voice, he can't believe, "You-... Are you..."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N, Noah, as he turned into golden motes, spoke to him when he was still a child, his eyes full of hope for his child's future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Father...?"</p>
<p>Matthew was late. He was still on his way, panting heavily along the road crossed by Grandad. Heavy sooty smokes and flaming speckles filled the air he breathed in, scorching his lungs; but he cannot stop now. He had to get to where the pillar of light is. But he did stop, seeing the City that reared him for the past 15 years came crashing down. There was nothing more painful than the loss of one's home sweet home{{footnote: At least in that moment.}}.</p>
<p>Secondary spider-like Moebius continued to roam the land, searching for any living beings that had not yet turned to light. The shirt and helmet remains laid on the ground, flattened as their flesh returned to Mother Earth, nowhere any longer.</p>
<p>Grandad was in disbelieve, questioned, "<em>Why are you doing this?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Hmm...</em>" Feeling queasy.</p>
<p>"But you told me <em>yourself</em>... You told me to make friends... " The last words before he disappeared when he was still a child still ringing in his ears. "<strong>Say</strong> something!"</p>
<p>Na'el, or either, Alpha, cut in and influenced, jumped to conclusion, "He doesn't want us here. We're a nuisance."</p>
<p>"<strong>Nuisance?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Right? <em>You</em> who've become <em>Moebius</em>. N... Isn't <em>that your name?</em>"</p>
<p>"You... <strong>Who are you? What've you done to Na'el?</strong>" His granddaughter wouldn't had known such secrets so easily. This is not her granddaughter.</p>
<p>Bickering each other isn't a strategy restricted to Alpha, and N answered him, "It's name is Alpha. An entity that wishes to <strong>erase</strong> this world."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"He's wrong." Alpha rebutted. Putting her hands on her heart, she said, "I want to embark on a journey to the future. There's <strong>just</strong> the matter of unwanted baggage."</p>
<p>"What're you <strong>talking</strong> about?"</p>
<p>"Lives." N answered.</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em> We Moebius, and... every last <strong>soldier</strong> on the face of this world."</p>
<p>"<em>I... What are...? And that's why, all this?</em>" He got more confused with the reasonings of both side.</p>
<p>And she took it as a proof, "See? We don't <strong>need</strong> them."</p>
<p>"I will... <em>I will arrest it.</em>" He put back his mask, continued, "This moment. <strong>This instant!</strong>" He put his hand on his sword. Alpha summoned her blade and ready to fight.</p>
<hr />
<p>He dashed backwards, then dashed quickly back at Alpha; she had no fight for him, his speed was too quick for her to do anything else than defend, "You're just Moebius... But... what's this power...?!"</p>
<p>"<strong>You would never understand. This is... MY CHOICE!</strong>" He tucked his sword back to its scabbard, and one slice broke her blade. Just before the sword pierce into her chest, she resummoned her blade and aimed a beam at the ground, using Newton's law to dodge such attacks. Later, she spit flames at him. But to no avail; her speed are too slow to hit him. No, not even suppressing fire.</p>
<p>"So you choose to stay in the now? To abandon the future?!"</p>
<p>"<strong>The one leaving things behind... IS YOU!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urgggghhhaaaahhh!!! Unggghhhhh..." She rolled and rolled on the ground, losing balance, having difficulty standing up. In a pleasing tone, she asked, "<em>Grandad, help... Please help...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Na'el...</em>" While they were fighting, he had time to think, to absorb the new information he'd just known, and to make up his choice, not joining.</p>
<p>"It is done, Alpha." One more time he stuck his sword back to the scabbard, to gather the chi into one single slash.</p>
<p>No time for Grandad to think as he saw him already dashing towards her; "<strong>Leave her!</strong>" He ran in between and caught his blade with his body.</p>
<p>"<strong>Ngh!</strong>" N was inherently surprised; he hadn't came for this. He didn't continue thrusting deeper.</p>
<p>"Na'el is... She's your family..." He peered over his shoulder, saw Alpha slowly getting on her feet, continued. "I can't let you do this..."</p>
<p>"<em>Ngh...</em>"</p>
<p>"What about Mum?"</p>
<p>"<em>Haaaa...</em>"</p>
<p>"Did <strong>she</strong>... want this too?"</p>
<p>"<em>You don't need to know. The burden is... mine alone to bear.</em>" Not to mention her, his voice became depressing. Gripping tighter by the hilt, blood dripped off his son's chest with greater thrusting force.</p>
<p>"<em>Huh huhhh... Mum would... tell you... to let it go, I'm sure... I know it... But you... you can't choose... this path...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Ghondor...</em>"</p>
<p>Matthew had been late into the party. "Huh huh huh huh <strong>Na'el! GRANDAD! HUUUUU!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>No time left. He cannot let Matthew came near. Ghondor told his dad, "This is the path... I have chosen." N gritted his fist and teeth more stronger. He won't let go. Then, spoke to "Matthew..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Grandad!</strong>" He dashed towards him, trying to save him, while waving away the black soot that blocked his view.</p>
<p>"Take care of... Na'el... the future..." He was too late. The bright Ouroboros power had glowed strong in his chest, his speech quicken, his soul escaping his body.</p>
<p>"<strong>GRANDAD!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"It's in your hands, Matthew!" And the explosion blew him away, shining so brightly that even the night turned into day. At his last moments, his soul flew towards Na'el's forehead, trying to shake out whoever is occupying his granddaughter's body. She cannot react. N, Matthew, and the others braced for impact.</p>
<p>"<strong>HUUURRRAAAAGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>After the explosion, N stood alone   amidst burning rubble. All buildings had been destroyed with the self-explosion his son led. He stood there, without his mask, speechless and emotionless.</p>
<p>M, Mio, who now became Moebius in silver armor,{{footnote: and just woken up, if you get the gist of it from Xenoblade 3 main story.}} teleported behind him, watched the desolated state with shaken heart. She looked at N's back; the final light in N's iris dimmed to depress.</p>
<hr />
<p>Matthew's fist was still in contact with N's sword. As the Ouroboros power dimmed down, they split, weakened by an immense loss of energy withdrew to replay history. N stayed on the ground, Matthew took to his feet. "What was that? Just now?" asked Glimmer.</p>
<p>"A memory from Origin," explained A. "The clash between Matthew and N afforded us a glimpse of it. This is how N <strong>truly</strong> felt."</p>
<p>Nikol: "That's some history. I can't imagine..."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>"</p>
<p>"The people who are of the City..." said he as he stood up, "are the future of this world. Huurrrgghhh..." He looked up at Origin. "And in Alpha's eyes,... they are a crucial source of power."</p>
<p>"So you killed them all... Killed Grandad..."</p>
<p>"It was Ghondor's <strong>choice</strong>. I simply <em>cut him down, as he desired.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Hurrr</strong>ghhh..." He clenched his fist tight. "<strong>STOP TAKING THE PISS!!!</strong>" He dashed towards him and grabbed him by his shoulder, looked at his eyes, "<strong>GRANDAD WOULDN'T... HE'D NEVER SIDE WITH THE LIKES OF YOU!!! 'THE FUTURE'S IN MY HANDS?' THAT CAN'T- BE- WHAT HE MEANT!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Hmph...</em>"</p>
<p>He dropped his head lower, eyes closed. "<em>You don't even see it...</em>" He sheathed his blade, asked philosophically, "<strong>Are you really... THAT. MUCH. OF. AN. IDIOT!!!</strong>" And punched him in his face. He didn't defend.</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh!</strong>" A was shocked.</p>
<p>"It's not just us, you know... It's your arse as well! <strong>It's all of that, and more, that he meant... And if YOU CAN'T GET THAT into your head, you're about the DUMBEST BASTARD THERE IS.</strong>"</p>
<p>N laid there, legs knelt on the ground, motionless and emotionless, letting him scold.</p>
<p>"<em>Matthew...</em>"</p>
<p>"Let's go. <strong>I don't have time for his idiocy.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Y-You're gonna leave him?!" Glimmer didn't see the gray in the black and white. "He's <em>Moebius</em>!"</p>
<p>He stopped, replied, "If he tries a stunt like that again, I'll just sock him another one. This was a <em>family matter</em>, through and through. End of story."</p>
<p>But someone didn't gave him a choice. Before they could react, an orange beam, the power of Alpha, shot down from Origin and strike N. "<strong>ARRRRGGGGHHHH!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>What?!!!</strong>" Rex was equally shocked.</p>
<p>"<strong>N!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>They looked up and saw Alpha Na'el floating up in the sky, "I've been waiting, brother dear." And they released an energy so thick like those faced by Z, Shulk, and Rex at the start of the chapter.</p>
<p>"<strong>ARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>A huge house with porch, double storey, green roofing, and wooden-tiled floorings. Outside it laid cut grass, moved lawn. Trees were planted by the sides for decorations. There were houses of similar size or smaller separating each other, forming a community, separated by gates cut out of bushes and streets. The radio tone loomed in the background, as if the voice appeared in their heads wherever they go. The radio was placed on a table in the porch of that particular house we just described.</p>
<p>(From here onwards, anything in comments like below will be speeches from the radio.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Good afternoon, this is 11 News. Wednesday, May 16th. Weather in the Rhadamanthus Authority, is fair. It is 24 degrees centigrade, 56% humidity.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a mowed lawn at another place, surrounded by metal gate, on a hilly top, Na'el stood alone, looking at the city far away. Buildings and houses built so close to each other, some tall, some short, as compressed as New York or the equivalent city of high density. On the very far side was a huge tower structure with a huge base, its 'pointed tip' with some rings on it reached much much taller than other buildings; not even skyscrapers could describe it -- the space lift{{footnote: One guessed this, because it goes directly up to reach space, and one can't think of any other structure.}}. Such structure was built on sea, for it's located at some distance outside the City's sea boundary.</p>
<p>Na'el was peacefully watching, wearing her normal light-brown jacket with inner Tees. No signs of Alpha's power emanating from her. All was peaceful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Continuing yesterday's placid highs, the day promises to be pleasant. Today's news will be delivered by me, Sienna Morgan, with additional analysis by our political correspondent, Barry Crow Li.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>His hands was still raised to protect from the light Na'el sent at him, found himself teleported under a morning sun, peaceful weather. With the others beside him, he looked around. Lamp post, street lights, houses, streets, pavement walks, trees, grasses, fire hydrants{{footnote: green, not red (in color).}} except there was nobody standing near. To the far side of where he was looking behind the trees was a step-up pavement towards the gated ledge.</p>
<p>The others equally scanned the surroundings. Some were fancied by the white wooden gates that provide no defense other than decorations; The houses with large windows and double storey, but no signs of cars and other objects. Trees, potted plants laid outside along the porch and building walls. Behind such red houses was a tall hill. Some other building that are equally tall but have huge doors, perhaps a community hall? Or maybe a Church? These buildings and houses so far described have chimneys on them.</p>
<p>A squinted as she looked around, unlike others in awe.</p>
<p>"Where's this?" asked Matthew.</p>
<hr />
<p>Then, they started walking around, particularly towards the gated ledge. Matthew: "Whoa. What's all this supposed to be?"</p>
<p>A: "Hmm..."</p>
<p>Nikol: "What is this place, seriously...?"</p>
<p>Shulk: "I don't know... But it looks like there's a path at least."</p>
<p>Glimmer immediately suggested, "Then let's follow it... <em>No point in hanging around here...</em>"</p>
<p>Rex warned, "Be careful. Place as strange as <strong>this</strong>, anything at all could happen."</p>
<p>The guys finally reached the gated ledge that overlooked the crowded city below; not the same place where Na'el stood before. They had their first view of the city below, though one could only see buildings and some open fields (like football or what fields), and some strange structures of circle buildings, perhaps for some high-tech vehicles' port/station that people could walk inside to have themselves transport around the city?</p>
<p>"Pretty..." commented Glimmer. "I've never seen anything like this."</p>
<p>"Wow. Those towers..." noted Nikol. "It's like they're all... sparkling..."{{footnote: That's due to the shiny surface and the reflection of the sun, by the way.}}</p>
<p>Panacea: "And that enormous one..."{{footnote: Talking about the space lift.}}</p>
<p>Linka stretched her head to max angle, but still can't see the top of it, "It's so huge... Bigger than a Castle."</p>
<p>"Hmm..." He had already thought of some things, being lived longer than most of them here except the few companions.</p>
<p>Rex nudged, "<em>Shulk. This what I think it is?</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah. The source of us all... Zanza... no, Klaus's world."</p>
<p>"<em>Before the fall...</em>"</p>
<p>"Mm..." he nodded.</p>
<p>"What was that about the world?" asked Matthew.{{footnote: He heard of this before, but only 'heard' but not 'experienced' it so deep that he knew them by heart, so he probably didn't get immediately reminded about when Shulk and Rex told him after the 'confession' earlier.}}</p>
<p>Shulk explained, "Before mine and Rex's worlds came to be, everything was one. And this is that place."</p>
<p>"Ermmmmmm..." He tried to recall. "What you said, at the base. About the two- worlds, before they- came together... <strong>This</strong> was even further back than those ones?"</p>
<p>Rex: "<em>The lad's got brawn and brains. I'm impressed.</em>"</p>
<p>"So what, we've traveled back <strong>into</strong> the past then?"</p>
<p>"No not really." thought Shulk. "This is Origin's memory stage. We- were- directly underneath it."</p>
<p>"Yeah." agreed Rex. "I think we're probably... inside of it now."</p>
<p>Glimmer tried to understand, "Meaning... <em>we're inside someone's memories?</em>"</p>
<p>A: "Of all the people who could remember this era, only one's left."</p>
<p>Rex: "<em>Alpha, eh? But what's the point of him showing us all this?</em> Is it really Alpha that's doing this? Or is it... <em>Hmm?</em>" He turned around as he heard piano playing in the background. The rest followed glance. It was behind some trees.</p>
<p>Matthew noted, "Piano? This- melody..." Exactly the ones he heard when Na'el was playing back at the City before its destroyed. The upright piano{{footnote: Old-style non-electric piano had 2 main types, the 'grand' ones, and the 'upright' ones.}} was placed in front of some bookshelf, the evening sun shining through the window on her left. "Huhhh..." He immediately dashed towards its source, finding road to it. The path and the staircase was just along the gates, and he ran there himself.</p>
<hr />
<p>Someone was playing behind the white mini-grand piano placed on the lawn. Tiles had been installed to withstand the weight of it. He took a walk closer to the side, to see her face. "<strong>Na'el...!</strong>" He immediately recognized, called out, but she was in her melody, too into the 'flow state' she cannot exit.</p>
<p>His voice registered a tad bit later. "Huh?" Wondering who was it, she looked up, elatedly called out, "<strong>Matthew! Welcome! I was waiting for you!</strong>" She jumped from her seat, reached out for the one whom came to join her, she guessed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the radio by the porch continued its news reporting. A jug of water and some plastic cups, or glass cups, and some desserts, had been placed at the round table beside the radio.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Well Barry, don't you think this weather we're having is just perfect?</em></p>
<p><em>I do. I think the spotless sky today will make it easy for us all to celebrate last night's momentous occasion.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Na'el... How- come- you're-..."</p>
<p>Still elated, she asked, "<strong>It's such a wonderful place, isn't it? I've always dreamed of this. A place we could live together. A place... to call home. And not just for you and me, but for everyone we know.</strong>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Well then, let's talk more about that. Most of our listeners know what we're talking about, but we'll recap for any latecomers. At midnight on the sixteenth, the first Rhadamanthus Spaceport saw the launch of Earthlife Colonization Project's{{footnote: Check out Xenoblade X for more details! And yes, by the time of writing, the definitive edition is about to come out next month!}} eighth mothership, the Icarus, taking 480, 000 settlers to the Eta Carinae Nebula in the Carina-Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way. The Icarus is the eighth interstellar colony ship dispatched as part of Project Exodus, bringing the total number of colonists sent out to the stars to 3 million. The Coalition government plans to send out ships nine to thirteen in the course of this year. The ninth vessel, departing in July, heralds a new generation of ultra-long range colony ships, known officially as Philadelphia-class motherships. Each vessel boasts a capacity of up to 1.5 million people, meaning that if all goes to plan, the project will send a total of 10 million people out into the great beyond.</em> {{footnote: While we aggregated everything into one big chunk, you should treat it as speaking in the background while all the events took place concurrently.}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Every- who?" He's sure he didn't saw anyone except for him; but the moment he looked to his right, children were running and playing and waving and greeting, enjoying their life. "Uh... <strong>When did they?</strong>" There was a creepy feeling by the gate: where had those whom joined him gone? Did they not ran after him?</p>
<p>"Hey, Miss!" One of the child called out to Na'el, attracting Matthew's attention too. "I'm huuunnnngrryyyy!!!" He turned and saw the children waving at them.</p>
<p>"<strong>Can we have a snack?</strong>" As the girl standing beside the first boy.</p>
<p>"<strong>OK!!!</strong>" replied Na'el happily as ever, like she always did to the children of the City. Then, she gave rules, "All right, wash your hands first, and then make a line. Because today... I've made something <strong>extra special</strong>."</p>
<p>"<strong>HURRRAYYYYY!!!</strong>" chanted all the children. Immediately, they dashed off, and the two had some time for themselves for the moment.</p>
<p>Na'el went to prepare the food while Matthew's eyes were still on the children. He followed thereafter. While she get the life she'd always wanted, he was more curious; but willing to not reject immediately, instead see for himself how events turned out.</p>
<p>By the roundtable where the radio and foods were, a wooden tray with muffins and bread and biscuits were placed. Cups with red liquid were poured out. "There's plenty to go around. Just let me know if you want seconds." She took it and handed it to the vibrating children.</p>
<p>"Hrrrgghhh..." He can feel her happiness, her dream, her relaxation. He didn't joined in; she'd always been the one to handle the children. Before was. Today is. But there was a thud. Without the promise of the real world, she resorted to live in her dreams. A dream she does not want to wake up from. He, however, had battles yet to fight, even if this is what she wants.</p>
<p>Clearing the tray, the kids went away; she put it back on the table.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Now for our next story. It concerns the 'Saviorite' Human Rights Protection bill, brought to congress last summer. Earlier today, we heard the 13 Authorities have petitioned against the proposal, and as the Justice Ministry's 7th Special Commission on Human Rights debates once more on its validity, the possibility that the proposal may be scrapped seems more and more likely. The proposed measure has sparked a lot of public debate, so many will be watching the government and the commission very closely.</em></p>
<p><em>There was much apprehension about the bill failing to make it all the way through the legislative process. And indeed, that seems to be exactly what's happening right now.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daylight turned quickly with a snap, and the evening sun shot over the horizon. The redness at the far end reflected off the shiny surface of the taller buildings facing an angle to where they watched. The children, active as ever, do not feel guilty playing whole day long{{footnote: instead of putting into 'useful', 'productive' work}}. His eyes fixated on her, walking back to beside him, told him,</p>
<p>"See? Isn't this great? There's no room for woes or worries here. Nothing to ruin our happiness. Out there... there's a world like <strong>this</strong> waiting. A place for new lives to live as they please. <em>Just like this.</em>"</p>
<p>Is it true? Can we humans really get rid of our woes or worries? Should we not, when we're rid of worries, invent new ones ourselves? For without worries, how are we to feel pleasure? Surely we need some baseline to compare to.</p>
<p>"<em>Na'el. You can't-...</em>"</p>
<p>"It was promised to me. <strong>By him!</strong>"</p>
<p>"'Him'?"</p>
<p>"Mmm... The person with the silver hair and kind eyes." The gratefulness in her tone, he felt uneasy about it. He had seen what he did to her; he had heard his goals and beliefs; but this is her say, not his. She continued, "He gave us this <strong>beautiful</strong> world. He said if we simply cast away the old lives..."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>And now, Dimitri Yuriev, councilperson from the Minos Authority, has issued a statement concerning the matter at hand. Please stay with us.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can the old lives really be simply casted away? Is that even a choice one can make? What happened to our identity therefore? Say, any of you easily accept a reformed prisoner as a friend, to bring them out, to accept them, to respect them, so they don't need to do things that put them back into trouble?</p>
<p>"We can set out, unburdened, and <strong>all this</strong> can be ours. <em>You see?</em>" And her tone turned harsh, "<em>We don't need any of this... old life...</em>" A shiver run down the skin. The background quiet to a stop after the flock of birds left the tree to the right. Is she beyond convince? Can he really reach out for her hearts, so deep, so cold? He felt he understood her, but he does not agree. Yet, he's not in the best place to open his mouth; any words might disrupt their already icy-point relationship to the point of no return. He's just there, within arms reach. He could hold on to her. But her hearts is far flung, across the ocean. The utopia she had decided to repeat forever, what can he do to wake her up?</p>
<p>"Certainly, it's beautiful." He hadn't yet came up with a carefully-prepared wordings before A sounded, and he saw the rest of the group entered through the gates. "If it could truly stay this way..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Hurrrghuuuhhh!!!</strong>" The words ring true, but she dare not guess.</p>
<p>"Na'el... Don't you know what came after? Have you ever seen it?"</p>
<p>"Mmphhhhh..." She dropped her head, unable to face herself.</p>
<p>"Weren't you ever... curious?"</p>
<p>She looked away.</p>
<p>"I think you suspect <strong>already</strong>. How it changed. What <strong>became</strong> of this world."</p>
<p>Her eyes fluttered, but she didn't stop her.</p>
<p>"And... how people have <strong>always</strong> been..."</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, looked out again. No more children. No other sound. No wind. This was the peace before the storm. "<strong>Huhhhh!!!</strong>" She started walking towards the gates.</p>
<p>A continued, "<strong><em>Ambition leads to pride.</em></strong> <strong>Even</strong> when they'd been granted <em>limitless</em> freedom, <strong>even</strong> having built the <em>perfect</em> world for themselves, humans yet desired the 'beyond'."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the space port or space station where Klaus's experiment lab were, there were space fighter jets around it fighting each other, shooting each other down. Some were not fighter jets but mechanoid robots that were built for destruction{{footnote: Pneuma once called it for help in Xenoblade 2. Check it out!}}, slicing the jets to pieces like knife cutting through tofu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"And then, the world became the way it is now." In the flick of her thoughts, thunder strikes. Tornadoes formed, engulfing the city in the distance. The thick cumulonimbus clouds covered the entire sky; no other light except the redness at the horizon could still be seen. Rain fell heavily, dripping wet their shirts and plants and wash the piano. Her quivering eyes could not believe the calmness of promised life turned into turbulent stormy seas, where sailors faced uncertainty every day, not sure when their boat would topple.</p>
<p>"<strong>LIES! This is all, LIES!</strong>" She snapped at A, "Don't think your ludicrous stories are going to change my mind! <strong>Alpha</strong>, he made me, an <strong>inviolable</strong> promise. <strong>He said, this is what awaits us at the end of our road. He said we could make a world like this!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Oh come off it!" Matthew called the bluff. "<strong>Really? You think that?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Of course I do!</strong>" she retorted, jumping to the conclusion in a split second. "<strong>Everything that we were denied is right here for us!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SCAM!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ugh..."</p>
<p>"<strong>WHEREVER YOU GO, IT'S THE SAME!!! YOU LEAVE 'THEM', IT ONLY ENDS ONE WAY.</strong>"</p>
<p>She desperately argued back, "<strong>Oh, so we should just let them keep killing each other! Killing, to live?! What a load of CRAP!!! Good riddance to ANYTHING THOSE 'BUTCHERS' WANT TO SAVE!!!</strong>" She looked away, unwilling to face him; she saw the reflection of the other side of her on his face, trying to shake her beliefs. She could not as easily shut her ears.</p>
<p>"<strong>They're not 'things'!!! They're lives!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huhuhhh!!" That struck a chord.</p>
<p>"And yeah, I can't forgive Moebius either. <strong>Reaping lives</strong> like grain during harvest... But come on... <strong>What crime have their VICTIMS ever committed? WHAT DID THEY DO???</strong> They weren't given a <em>single choice.</em> They were just trying to make the most of <em>each</em> moment, like us!"</p>
<p>"Ngh..." Nikol and Glimmer's can relate to what he'd just said.</p>
<p>"<strong>Everyone you know DIED for that! Are you OK with that, Matthew?!</strong>"</p>
<p>The remain of Chyra's corpses evaporated before her hands. The lifeless corpses that'd long gone, only their belongings placed a human shape on the ground, in the raging fire the day the City fell. "<strong>COURSE I'M BLOODY NOT!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ungh huh!"</p>
<p>"Truth is... What you're talking about of doing, would make <em>you</em> <strong>exactly</strong> the same as Moebius."</p>
<p>"Ugh!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Exactly</strong> the same! <strong>If you build a new world on that foundation, it'll only end one way. LIKE THIS!!!</strong>" No longer were they shiny; the heavy torrential rain had ran on for too long, making pillars brittle. Some would soon collapse under its own weight.</p>
<p>"<strong>THIS HERE?! AND THIS IS THE FUTURE YOU WANT?!</strong>" Her irises in REM state, fighting against both side of herself as Matthew threw in logs and coals and fire to help the other side of her.</p>
<p>"You see, Na'el? The lives that you and I have... You know that's a possible future for <strong>all</strong> the soldiers, right?" And he reached out for his pocket and took out the picture of Noah and Mio and his Grandad, showed it to her. "If it weren't for those guys, <em>we wouldn't even be here.</em> Don't lose sight of the real enemy. You know who it is. Moebius, or Alpha... It doesn't matter what you call 'em. The real enemy's whoever threatens our lives... Whoever tries to rob us of our hopes and dreams."</p>
<p>As she spoke, his voice in the background, his focused on Noah and Mio and their grandad; they were the first generation that liberated, together with their friends, and built the first City. Without the City, she wouldn't have 15 years of peace, and the plethora of children she'd grown up with, took care of, shielded under her. No, all would be chained in the unending warring state; none would had escaped the flow.</p>
<p>He invited, "<em>Let's build a future, Na'el.</em> The one our elders wanted... with our own hands! C'mon. What do you say?"</p>
<p>She looked up and saw him handling over his hand. Would he had reached her?</p>
<p>"<em>Matthew...</em>" Tears at the tip of her eyes, she slowly reached for his palm with her right hand, the left caught hold of the picture of hope. His reasoning is sound, his emotions were tight. An empty promises cannot fight a strong foundation built with their own hands. The future might be far; she might not lived to see it; but hey, at least hope was there. We can become a good ancestor to our fellow offspring.</p>
<p>But someone doesn't want her to get back to his laps. "Urrrghhuhhh!!!"</p>
<p>He could only watched in awe, "<strong>NA'EL!!!</strong>" The bright beam blazed behind her, sucked her closer and closer towards the beam like a spider going down a vacuum cleaner; and he could not do anything about it.</p>
<p>Hands holding out but cannot reach, she cried, "<strong>MA-... MATTHEW!!!</strong>" Before disappearing into the pillar of light.</p>
<p>He stumbled a few steps forward, trying to reach out for her. The strong energy washed all paints of memories away into sparkles. The true metallic floor had been revealed; and indeed, they were now inside Origin. Alpha's suit had been automatically wore on Na'el; she was rendered unconscious, held mid-air as if a cross had pinned her down like it had pinned Jesus thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>"What a farce. Your rhetoric is rife with falsehoods." Above Na'el, space broke open like it was 2D, forming an eye-like void which emits light and black fog. Alpha, in his own form, wielding his Monado, once again, appeared before the group. Except, the god's wing he had that floats behind him like butterfly wings, now only had its right side, "I cannot stand such drivel."</p>
<p>"Alpha..."</p>
<p>"I safeguard this world, by removing what is timeworn. But it seems that you continue to contravene me. You <strong>spur</strong> these <strong>olden</strong> mortals to action."</p>
<p>"I am your conscience."</p>
<p>"'Conscience'? Ahah... There is no place for it in the Trinity Processor."</p>
<p>Rex: "It's you there's no place for... Alpha. 'Cause Klaus... He entrusted the future to us. So he could atone for his past. <strong>He followed</strong> his conscience."</p>
<p>"And he failed to realize that his '<em>conscience</em>' led him astray. An atavistic delusion. It is <strong>common</strong> among the old. <strong>Wholly unnecessary</strong> for all subsequent life."</p>
<p>Matthew: "<em>I knew it...</em> Of course that would be your vision of the world." He then point his index finger at him, "As long as there's <strong>people</strong> like you, nothing's ever going to change. Casting off the old world, and its people, and just <strong>walking</strong> away."</p>
<p>"You could not comprehend it, Matthew."</p>
<p>He paused for more than 3 seconds, before rebutting, putting down his finger, "Turning around, going back... Looking for a new way forward... Doing that time and again, that's how you build a future. <em>Eh, but you're just an obsolete piece of scrap, so</em> no wonder you don't get it!"</p>
<p>"You said I am <strong>obsolete</strong>?"</p>
<p>He turned to A, whose eyes charmed, nodded back with a thin smile. "<em>Life is on our side.</em> And since there's none in you... <strong>You're destined for the scrap heat!</strong>"</p>
<p>A: "Let's do this, Matthew. Time to bring things to an end!"</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-10"><a class="header" href="#footnotes-10">Footnotes:</a></h3>

<p>Matthew dragged backwards and stood up to face Alpha again. He was exhausted, but it's not the time to fall yet. He seemed invincible, releasing only more energy as time passed. He had difficulty even to get near him. Gradually, the power of Ouroboros he released, pressurized by the power of Alpha, pulled his soul out of his cask. The others had difficulty maintaining their own balance, what says helping him.</p>
<p>Shulk: "<strong>Careful!</strong>"</p>
<p>Rex: "<strong>Crap!</strong> Now he's trying to suck Matthew in too!"</p>
<p>A: "He's found it... The trace of turmoil, that's still within him..." The memories with Na'el, the last moments of Grandad, the wish to find back the people of the City, these memories flowed through him.</p>
<p>Alpha deluded, "Discard the past. Let it all go, Matthew." Despite efforts, his soul moved forward, one step by another, as the black hole overcame his will.</p>
<p>"I... I won't...!" Na'el was still unconscious, hung upon the air, 'waiting' for him.</p>
<p>"What harm did your kind do? You have done nothing wrong. You simply strode forth towards the future. But the olden humans... They did <strong>not</strong> find value in it. You must have realized? This is <strong>not</strong> where you belong."</p>
<p>"St... <strong>Stop</strong>..."</p>
<p>"Why make a martyr of yourself? Why be a stepping stone? For as long as the old is not excised, mankind, has no future!"</p>
<p>"<em>The old... you say?</em>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It's in your hands, Matthew!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"<em>Gotta be... kidding me... I'm... nowhere near done yet... I'm not dying with so much... left undone... I'm not... <strong>DONNNNNNEEEEEEEEEE!!!</strong></em>"</p>
<p>His shouts may had been heard. A purple beam stroke from above, broke the veil created by Alpha's energy, and sliced at Alpha. The Sword of the End pushed through and punctured his strength to none. His soul bumped back to his cask like an undeformed spring returning to its original state. Effete from fighting his will, he dropped to the ground. The hold on Na'el released, and she dropped to the ground, slammed under gravity's pull. Her shirt of Alpha disappeared.</p>
<p>Matthew immediately regained strength after a few moments of rest, dashed towards his sister.</p>
<p>Nikol shouted, "<strong>Matthew! Na'el!</strong>" And he followed behind. Matthew dropped to the ground and hugged her up, putting her between his hands. The rest of the group got near, shielded them as they reunited.</p>
<p>Glimmer's eyes wandered to the one whom sliced him down; he stood up, not looking at them. "<em>You again...!</em>"</p>
<p>Matthew: "N..."</p>
<p>"Don't- mistake- me. I am one who lives in the now. <strong>My blade knows no regrets.</strong>" Though his blade reverberated with the frequency of Nature.</p>
<p>"Huh... I thought you'd say that. And that's why..." He brushed his fingers through Na'el's forehead, despite her hair. "I can't afford to just take off."</p>
<p>"Mm Hmm..." She slowly opened her eyes, feeling the tickle.</p>
<p>"<em>Hey...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Matthew...</em>"</p>
<p>"Hey. You OK?"</p>
<p>"<em>Mm.</em>"</p>
<p>"Then... let's seize it together." With his help, she stood up, embraced. "Our true future."</p>
<p>"Hrrr... <em>I'm sorry...</em>"</p>
<p>"It's nothin'." Then called out, "N!" He's still looking away. "I've got a crapload of stuff I wanna say to you. But right this instant, I'm glad we're both fighting on the same side." He's not yet fallen, just temporarily stunned. "<strong>Am I right?</strong>" asked he to his team. No objections! "There you go. <strong>Mr. Alpha, sir. You wanna go so badly, then pick up and go! THIS WORLD - IT BELONGS TO US!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Regrettable, Matthew. I'd hoped that we could celebrate the day of departure together. But very well... It seems that I must forsake you.." His tone slowly changed from a soft one to more robotic and abominable. "The olden ones, olden life... Your olden notions!" Slowly by slowly, he retreated back into the void, merging with it.</p>
<p>The void gone and closed, darkness veiled the interior of Origin. The ground shook a few seconds later; he had not escaped. Slowly, they waited. Far away, rocks were sent along the boundary as light came to being -- the Big Bang. Wiping against all, the Aurora light formed their background against a non-starry sky. A ring with the void far in the distance, an eye peering at them. Alpha left an island floating amidst all, a space for them to stand. The asteroids reached the boundaries, forming a belt that rotated the battlefield. The void grew larger and splatted intense energy at the island. Sideways they stood, to cut through the waves. Into existence an elemental creature formed, with two arms and butterfly-like wings, veiled in light so bright there's no texture. It shook off the light to reveal its DNA-wings, its dark bony hands, the white-red body, a priest-like attire wore around its head, and the head like a factory-made robot's. It raised one of its hands, summoned the giant Monado, and brushed at the group's top.</p>
<hr />
<p>A hit one side; it aimed at her. Shulk attacked another side, got back on ground, exclaimed, "<strong>He's still standing...! After all this?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Cheers to old Klaus!</strong>" Rex ran towards it while it was focusing on Shulk. "<strong>His gifts just keep on giving!</strong>" All attacks never hurt its surface, even if it leaves smokes.</p>
<p>It raised the Monado, gathered energy, bashed at Rex, whom had no time to dodge, blocked it head to head. "<strong>Urrrrgghhh ARRRGGGHHH!!! DAMMIT!!! IF ONLY 'THOSE TWO' WERE HERE!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>N took the chance and slashed, but Alpha dodged it. He plucked the sword back into its scabbard, dropped beside "Matthew." What had he got to say? "Raise up your fists."</p>
<p>"What?" He looked at it. Only Ouroboros power in it, what?</p>
<p>"I will grant you the sword's power." Both his fist and the sword reverberates. "Transfer it to your... 'Fists of the End'."</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>A dropped down, noticed, "That light!"</p>
<p>Rex cannot understand, "No way..."</p>
<p>N shouted, pulling out his sword, "<strong>DRIVE IT IN!!! RELEASE THE POWER OF OUROBOROS!!!</strong>" He stuck it into the ground of Origin, releasing a huge amount of Ouroboros power despite being a Moebius himself. The energy acted as a catalyst for Matthew to activate more power.</p>
<p>"<strong>Shut the hell up already!</strong>" He jumped into the air, while still had time to complaint, "<strong>I ain't taking orders... from you!</strong>" His Fist of the End shattered into pieces, revealing a cross-like gem encased on the back of his fist. The power of Pneuma. "<strong>ARRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!</strong>" He punched it into the Sword of the End, hoping to pierce it deeper into the ground. Ouroboros power released in even more strength, brushed through his friends it.</p>
<p>Rings of energy slowly veiled everyone as the Ouroboros symbol glowed in everyone's eyes, the ring engulfed their body from toe to head, and they became the Ouroboros Core we saw on the main Xenoblade 3 story. All flew high up into the air, zoomed and swooshed and rotated, before forming into one. The precursor of Ouroboros in the future, with more than a single core -- each held a position of chest, both hands, both legs, and one on its lower abdomen -- on an illusory Dharma.</p>
<p>Alpha prepared a strike, it prepared a punch. The punch reached Alpha's face, the sword, despite longer, sliced above the shoulder of the Dharma, not breaking it, being illusory. A bright light engulfed, and in such space, Alpha, in his regular shirt, addressed,</p>
<p>"<em>Matthew... Your actions have made the future uncertain. Have you no regrets? Given a choice of this magnitude... Surely... there is doubt</em>." It's only him and Matthew; motes floating off him as he was about to die; he's losing his legs currently.</p>
<p>"Oh believe me, got 'em in spades." Alpha was surprised, and he can't understand. "That's why we move forward,... always ahead." The rest of the group joined him, watching behind.</p>
<p>He thought for a while, "Hmph..."</p>
<p>Matthew turned around, "See ya. Alpha." And walked away, while the light engulfed him and himself only, no more words to say. At the end of his life, he saw him joined with his group.</p>
<p>N was not in the group, as expected; stayed outside the blinding space. Matthew, back at the real space, looked at him; his sword tucked back into the scabbard, still reverberating, standing there speechless. The rest waited in silence, until a punch was heard. Looking around, it was as if Origin interior was to be destroyed.</p>
<p>A knew, her time had come. Bright light glowed on her surface, but not bright enough for Matthew to notice yet. Similarly for Rex, as motes also appeared. And equally, Shulk. But their smiles revealed they knew what would've happened.</p>
<p>Shulk: "Right we are. Just one last thing then." That attracted Matthew attention, whom saw him started walking forward, confused.</p>
<p>Rex: "Yeah. You got it."</p>
<p>"H-hey!" They had not told him this would've happened? Who said they had no more secrets to withhold? They were reaching for the bright blue light where Alpha had fallen.</p>
<p>Matthew was stunned when A stood beside him, explained, "Alpha was... And I am.. an avatar. The spirit of your world." While she walked slowly towards the beam, she continued, "Just like Alpha needed <strong>all</strong> of you, you and your world, you need me."</p>
<p>"<strong>An 'avatar', what?</strong>"</p>
<p>Their head not turning back, Rex spoke, "It's no more. So someone else has to pick up the slack. <em>The annihilation events, they'll keep happening whether you like it or not.</em>" He stopped for a while, looked back at him, "The world needs a bit of propping up."</p>
<p>Shulk stopped and turned his too, "Until the time comes, yes."</p>
<p>Glimmer felt nervous, dashed forward a few steps, "Hold up a minute, Who's 'someone'? And for how long?"</p>
<p>Rex bit his tongue and answered, "Hmph... Well... you work that part out."</p>
<p>"Urghhh..." Matthew and Nikol equally felt a bang in their stomach.</p>
<p>Nikol especially shook his head, don't want regrets, started dashing towards Shulk, stopped in front of him, "<strong>DON'T DO THIS!!! HURGGGHHH! YOU DON'T HAVE TO SACRIFICE YOURSELVES!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"It's not like that. We're helping."</p>
<p>Glimmer started to pick pace towards him too, "And that's different how exactly?"</p>
<p>"Fundamentally." Rex immediately shot back. She stopped and looked to her right, where Rex was walking towards her, "Glimmer. As long as you lot do your part to change this world, it'll all go back to normal."</p>
<p>"And if we don't manage, then what? My lifetime... it's barely a blip."</p>
<p>"<strong><em>If you don't, pass it on!</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Let someone else carry on your dream. That's how we've always rolled. Us lot."</p>
<p>Shulk: "It's not much, but we can offer you a gift." He looked at Rex, both agreed, "We can imbue you with our life, keep the wheels turning. That way, you'll be able to live out the rest of your lives. Enough time to do what you must." He put his hands on Nikol's shoulder.</p>
<p>"<strong>No, but-!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Oh, hey. Don't get us wrong now."</p>
<p>Glimmer looked aside and saw a big palm aiming for her head, "Urg,... urm..." closed her eyes, and felt the pat, but did not pull away. "We're just... taking a breather. It's all right. We'll meet again. Trust me."</p>
<p>"Uhm..." Nikol still felt not right. Can he really trust them?</p>
<p>Linka and Panacea did not joined in their family reunions, feeling sad, or in Linka's part, crying, at the back, looking.</p>
<p>"Teacher..."</p>
<p>"Boss..."</p>
<p>A crossed her arms, strictly speaking, destroying the sadness atmosphere, "This is against the rules. You know this."</p>
<p>Both turned around and joked, Rex: "Don't be a spoilsport now. If it was <em>'them'</em>... <em>I don't think they'd even bat an eyelid</em> at helping." His eyes turned to N's Sword.</p>
<p>"Hrmph... Admittedly..." A looked at N's sword and Matthew's fist. "Well, I suppose you have earned it. Very well then. I didn't see or hear anything."</p>
<p>Shulk, "Thanks a lot, 'Alvis'." The bright light from Shulk spread to Nikol, Rex to Glimmer. Both enchained the powers to remove their Term Symbol shackles.</p>
<p>"Then... It's all up to you now. With us taking the role of the avatar, Z may well seize upon it to gain power. What we did, and all that concerns Origin, will become but a dim memory... Nevertheless, our <strong>intentions</strong> will live on,... and one day, coalesce again. Be it tomorrow... or in a thousand years... Surely, the time will eventually come. I can see it, clear as day."</p>
<p>No more speaking. Three of them turned and went for their destined fate. The rest froze and watched, unable to change.</p>
<p>Rex: "Our future... is in your hands."</p>
<p>Shulk: "We'll be waiting, at the far edge of time."</p>
<p>Matthew took a step forward, but nodded in return, against his emotions. Peering over their shoulders{{footnote: not including A}}, they were glad he agreed. Even N watched their disappearance.</p>
<p>Inside the light pillar, now that others cannot hear them, Shulk asked, "You actually did see it coming, didn't you? All that's happened..."</p>
<p>Rex strongly believed: "Right? And all that will."</p>
<p>"The only thing I see is... what the flow encompasses... <em>But your hope lives on.</em> That much is certain."</p>
<p>Outside, Origin's rotating blades halt after their disappearance. Without such anti-gravity device working, it gets pulled down into the sea below, its trajectory aimed to destroy all lands below it. The City people had already been prepared, boarded their repaired Armories for an escape. As the flames burned on the heat shield of Origin, the crash sunk the ground, explosion ensued, and land became sea.</p>
<hr />
<p>Origin sank into the sea, bringing with it huge waves where it hits. Rocks, probably the tops of mountains, still visible as small rocks protruding out the surface of the waters. The impact so huge it carved a huge semicircle cliffs around where it was, and water falls from the remaining sea down to the bottom{{footnote: Though one don't know how it was recycled back to the top, given the amount of liquid falling down doesn't seem to one refillable by rain per se.}}.</p>
<p>Rain drops as the group was set to the top overwatching the misty horizon where Origin sank. Matthew stood in the middle, the others still alive to his right, and N to his left, each separated by a huge distance. His sword was still out of the scabbard.</p>
<p>After reminiscing for a while, sending those that can't be seen any more, Matthew diverted his attention, "Righty-ho... Wanna get back to it, then?" He prepared to fight with N, although without calling his blades.</p>
<p>"I highly doubt you have the strength left."</p>
<p>"Same goes for you." After all, his sword remained pointed at him, though none of them moved. In the far distance, light beams pierced through thick cumulonimbus clouds, as if angels were to return to 'Earth' from such beams.</p>
<p>Physical strength lost doesn't mean mouth strength lost, "Moebius will never change. In any way. Forever transfixed. They will guard the '<strong>endless</strong> now' to the last."</p>
<p>"Including you?"</p>
<p>"Naturally." And he tucked his sword back to the scabbard, seeing the fight won't continue.</p>
<p>He retreated his offense mode, "Well then, we'll be busy."</p>
<p>"What if you cannot make it happen? Your lives are <strong>pitifully</strong> short."</p>
<p>"<em>Heheh.</em> We went over this. <strong>You got wax</strong> in your ears? If I can't, someone else will, down the line." N looked at him and the others; nobody hesitated. He turned around and walked away, seeing no convincing will happen, calling back his mask. Then, Matthew continued, "<em>Who knows...</em>" It stopped him. "Maybe it'll even be <strong>you</strong>." He said nothing, teleported away.</p>
<p>The beam in the distance signified a new starting point; whatever the future lies ahead, this is the path they'd chosen, and that they'll walk down it, without regret.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside some coverings where rocks of pointed tips cover some of the sunlight above, the armories had parked and settled their new colony here. It seemed to be a temporary location, by the beach, and some armories even parked on the sea-part near the beach. Tents were set up. People were busy rebuilding the colony. City people, children, Nopons, all helped out; well, children plays. Cooking or what, they have to settle for communism temporarily{{footnote: When civilization starts small, before things become complicated, it <strong>always</strong> starts with communism, then gradually, people aren't happy of being in par with others, for Mother Nature wants competition; then people abandon communism and went for something more complicated -- monarchy, democracy, socialism, you name it. When war destroyed everything down to the ground, and by everything wipe out, one really mean <strong>everything</strong>, communism starts again, to rebuild the colonies. Those community that aren't wiped out during a war don't need to restart from communism.}}</p>
<p>"Cough cough..." There was an explosion at one of the places, but nobody reacted to it; they had already got used to it. After the smoke died down, Riku, standing beside the Ouroboros Stone, complaint, "<strong>Friend fail yet again! Did Riku not say? Should not use so much Noise Bite!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>WHUH?!!!</strong>" Nikol remembered he didn't heard that from him. "<strong>You said to throw in a bunch of them, you told me!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Riku did not!</strong>" Now the Ouroboros Stone was on smoke, they had to restart whatever they were doing. "<strong>Nikol must have poor hearing.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Eeeeerrrrrrmmmm...</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urhurg urhurg..." Glimmer walked into the scene, covering her eyes and nose, flapping away the smoke with another, towards Nikol. "Honest to spark... You're still going at it?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean 'still'? It has to be done! We're- powering up the Ouroboros Stone... Just about done with it now." That he and Riku, after the smoke gone dead, went back to work. Without looking, he took some thing, perhaps towel, from Glimmer naturally, continued, "We've accumulated all this data. Now if we could only encode it... in the operative photon wave frequency."</p>
<p>She went to the table at the side and slightly sit on it, get a cup for herself and drank the content while asking, "If you get it to work, we'll be able to deploy that power whenever we feel like it, right?"</p>
<p>"Right. I'll admit the photons have limited <strong>capacity</strong>, so we won't be able to empower... <strong>quite</strong> that many people all in one go..."</p>
<p>"Hmmm..." Something came into her head, why she was here in the first place. "Oh! More importantly, you <strong>don't</strong> wanna be late. The send-off?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Hurggghhhh!!!! OHH, THAT'S RIGHT!!!</strong>" Even Riku fluttered his wings as he was reminded. He immediately ran. Nikol took some time to stand up, "I better get moving!"</p>
<p>"Ahahaha!" And Glimmer went after him.</p>
<p>At the new entrance, Matthew was packing his little sack as luggage while the others were following behind. Na'el asked, "Take care, alright? You sure you're going to be fine alone?"</p>
<p>"Whoa, yeah! It'll be a relief if anything."</p>
<p>Glimmer: "<em>Well, someone's full of himself...</em>"</p>
<p>Nikol ran up beside him, "Matthew... Thank you... for everything."</p>
<p>"<em>Ahuh! And thanks right back atcha.</em>"</p>
<p>Reaching the entrance, he stopped and turned to the sending off group. "Also, while I'm gone, keep an eye on the City, eh? Na'el. Nikol. Glimmer. Panacea. Linka. Oh, <strong>and you,</strong> Riku."</p>
<p>"Why Riku last?"</p>
<p>"Ahahahaha!"</p>
<p>Na'el was insecurely looking down, seemingly her tears were gathering at the tip of her eyes. "Ungh..." Then, a huge hand rubbed her in her head. "<strong><em>Once I've found us some friends, I'll come home again.</em></strong>"{{footnote: Check the appendix for his status at the end of his life, what people said of him, encarved at his statue at the new City's memorial hall.}}</p>
<p>"<em>Mh hmm... Get back safe.</em>"</p>
<p>"Sure!" Turning without looking back, he shouted to the sky whom welcomed him a new journey, "<strong>Arrighty! Time to start REBUILDING the world. MATTHEW VANDHAM... is outta here!</strong>"</p>

<p>Across the bridge from colony 9, where the broken armories were parked, on a warm, sunny day, Dillon was looking at them when the side of his eye caught the group walking towards him. He therefore greeted, "Oh, hey, Matty."</p>
<p>"Hey yourself, Dillon. Whatcha up to here?"</p>
<p>"Ah, well, y'know... Just thinking about things. Life. Where we're going. Know what I mean?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... City's on your mind?"</p>
<p>"Bingo. Things'll never go back to normal for us if we don't get this rebuilding done. One day soo, we'll have to get started. We'll need to scout out a new location... So with this and that, I figured it might help to have the Armories operational, y'know? But in Shulk's estimation, it'd be too much of a chore for the mo.{{footnote: 'moment'.}}"</p>
<p>Shulk shared his logic, "Repairing such a large piece of machinery would require a lot of worker-hours. The internal wiring is also a lot more complicated than it appears at first glance... I wouldn't be a simple job, simply put."</p>
<p>Matthew listened, then asked, "So, have you talked to the others about this?"</p>
<p>"No, not yet. Why, what are you thinking?"</p>
<p>"That's perfect, then. I'll take this to 'em."</p>
<p>"But, Matt, we'll never manage alone..."</p>
<p>"That's why I wasn't gonna suggest doing it alone. I wanna ask the Liberators for their help."</p>
<p>Dillon's eyes widened up, asked in surprise, or perhaps, in shock, "<strong>What...? This is a City problem,</strong> Matt. You really want to get them involved in it?"</p>
<p>"That's <strong>your</strong> problem right there, Dill."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"<strong><em>You gotta stop dividing the world into 'us' and 'them'.</em></strong> I know we were always livin' in our own little bubble, but it's like... Us and the Liberators, we're tight now. Dontcha think? Honestly, we're pretty much a family." He turned around and asked Shulk and Rex, "You're with me on this, yeah?"</p>
<p>They looked at each other, and Rex answered, "Hrmm... Might have to chew on that one for a bit."</p>
<p>"Aw, come on, man, don't be such a killjoy!"</p>
<p>Shulk suggested, "Matthew, if you truly believe that, you need only reach out to them. See if they reciprocate how you feel."</p>
<p>A grim grew on his face, he replied, "Yeah. I was thinking of doing <em>just that</em>."</p>
<p>Dillon put his hand over his forehead, "You're something else, Matt, I swear..."</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, I'll be sure to do something about the whole Armory business. And mate... stop trying to do things alone. We're all in this together."</p>
<p>"Yeah, all right,I get the message! Flippin' poser... Well, guess I'll just have to hold you to it."</p>
<p>He nodded, turned around, announced, "<strong>Aight, guess it's time to do the rounds!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>The group waited while Matthew himself talked with the Liberators (including those former soldiers liberated). After explaining the situation, Lucille, a tanned skin woman with goggles over her head wearing City's armor plates, shook her head: "I actually tried looking into it one time myself, but it seemed like a massive pain to fix up. Didn't know where to start."</p>
<p>Hamill, possibly her partner, cheered up, "But it's definitely possible, right? That is, leaving cost out of the equation."</p>
<p>Peridot, a former Kevesi soldier, sensed her turn to speak, "Bringing the cost down is exactly why we're needed here, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Jethro don't understand, like Dillon, "But Matthew, isn't this a City problem? Do <em>we</em> really need to <em>beg</em> for help...?"</p>
<p>Eow, a former Agnian soldier, disagreed with him, "If it enables us to use aerial routes, our logistics will get a much-needed boost in efficiency. Getting it done would benefit everyone here. I think we'd be mad to pass this one up."</p>
<p>"Uh, right... Valid point."</p>
<p>Lucille: "All on the same page, then? Great! Now how about we get to laying the groundwork?"</p>
<p>Peridot: "If there's anything we can do to help, just shout. We'll sort it out."</p>
<p>Eow suggested, "Better start rounding up the materials. Can someone get a list going?"</p>
<p>Jethro: "All right then. We'll defer to you here, Matthew."</p>
<p>Matthew agreed, replied, "I appreciate the vote of confidence."</p>
<hr />
<p>At the Square, Matthew again speaking to various people, while the rest of the team waited 10 feet away.</p>
<p>One of the fair-skinned buff guy with his red hair gelled like Spartan's, complaint, "Well! First the Remembrance Stone, and now the Armories? You sure like to keep honest people busy, huh!"</p>
<p>Cathy, the short-haired woman standing beside him, her height to his shoulder, teased, "Heh, I know you. You're just happy he came to you, aren't you?"</p>
<p>An old man shook his head, commented, "This place is safe, but it's not 100% absolutely forever-safe... Might be good to have an exit strategy in place."</p>
<p>Another guy standing beside the old man, his ears with crystals, gave permission, "I'll be more than happy to help too, Matthew! Although I'm not great with machines... Still, please find me something to do!"</p>
<p>Georgie, the one wearing glasses, commented, "It'll be a lotta people working on this. Gonna be hectic as heck."</p>
<p>Matthew: "You know it. But if it's your curry fueling 'em, they'll have the energy to move mountains!"</p>
<p>"<strong>That's</strong> a lot of faith to put in one <em>humble</em> dish... but <strong>sure thing!</strong> If they keep eating it, I'll keep making it."{{footnote: Oh, so you're the store owner that sells curry, Georgie!}}</p>
<p>Ruben laughed out loud, "<strong>BAHAHAHAH!!! I'm already itching to get started!</strong>"</p>
<p>Cathy: "Any careful tinkering needs doing, you point me at it and watch me go."</p>
<p>Miguel: "I've got some nimble fingers myself. Hope I can put them to good use."</p>
<p>Mickey found himself a job, "<strong>Oh, I know!</strong> I'll go round up more hands! The more people helping us, the better!"</p>
<p>Matthew: "Thanks, everyone. Couldn't do it without you."</p>
<hr />
<p>Still at the square, but with another group of people. Again, the group waited while Matthew spoke with them. Janus, gray-haired young man, was excited, "<strong>Forsooth!</strong> You wish for mine help in the great work of restoring yon Armories to their former glory?!"</p>
<p>Lui, a female with sharp chin and short hair, commented 'sad'-ly{{footnote: What the spark???}}, "High time."</p>
<p>Lottie, the green-haired girl next to her, was much more excited than her, "Didn't think I'd get to fly in an Armory again... Honestly, I can't wait."</p>
<p>Kayleigh, the red-haired winged female, had questions, "Is this a directive from the Liberators' top brass then, Matthew?"</p>
<p>"Ah, nah, not this time. You're free to take the job or leave it. Whatever suits ya."</p>
<p>"So you're leaving it to our discretion?"</p>
<p>The male beside her was thinking, "Hmm... Well then, our answer is obvious, isn't it?" They looked at each other.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I believe so." Both looked back at Matthew, "Harby and I will take part in your project. We'd be glad to lend you our assistance."</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah? You sure?"</p>
<p>"Both in Keves and Agnus, we're taught to value our comrades. To have each other's backs. This choice is no choice at all."</p>
<p>Lottie: "Ahahah, nice speech! That's hit me right in the tear ducts."</p>
<p>"We can try to canvass for more volunteers from our side as well. Would that be OK?"</p>
<p>"Yeah? <strong>Sweet! If you could!</strong> That'd be a big help."</p>
<p>Janus went up and patted on Matthew's shoulder, excitedly exclaimed, "<strong>Young Master Matthew! Prithee, forget not your humble servant, me!</strong>" Matthew was slightly shocked and took a step back, looked at him and listened to his speech.</p>
<p>Lui saw such interaction and commented, "Suck up..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Still another group by the turn of the street, Carrom, green-haired tanned skinned, just knew, "So those big transport ship things are called Armories, are they?"</p>
<p>Axel the kid was more excited, "You think the Armories can still fly?"</p>
<p>Finley, the female kid, was equally excited, "I wanna help! Lemme help!"</p>
<p>Saomi, with two crystal thorns on her head and ruby red iris, questioned, "Hrm, OK, but, like... Is that meant to be on <em>top</em> of our Liberator duties, or...?"</p>
<p>Hyzen was sour-faced, shook his head, "Saomi, please stuff a sock in it..."</p>
<p>Carrom heard these two were more unwilling to do jobs outside their current job, strictly spoke, "One day, Linka's gonna stop covering for you, and on that day, I'll be ready to teach you the meaning of real, honest work..."</p>
<p>Saomi retorted, "Uh, <strong>I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it, did I?! Way to stereotype someone!</strong>"</p>
<p>"So you'll help, then?" asked Matthew.</p>
<p>Carrom answered immediately, "Sure, happily... Though you might want to relegate me to lugging stuff around."</p>
<p>Hyzen offered his role, "I did some Levnis maintenance back in Keves, so I might be able to do a bit more."</p>
<p>Saomi: "Ehhh, might as well. Can't turn down a bud in need now, can we?" Matthew nodded back at the kids eager faces.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Oh, you're back? How'd it all-" He hadn't finished and saw 'soldiers' marching through the bridge, shocked by the sheer number of people willing to lend a hand. "<strong>Hahahahah, wow, you were busy!</strong>"</p>
<p>"See, Dillon? What'd I tell you? Us City folk and the Liberators, we're all birds of a feather now. Don't knock a bit of camaraderie till you've tried it, eh?"</p>
<p>"Heh, you got me there..." He scanned the people. Countable but uncountable. Now, that was some headache, "Well, one thing's for sure. Wherever we found the next City, we'll need to make sure there's lots of room."</p>
<p>"That's the spirit, mate."</p>
<p>Lucille, accompanied by another guy, walked forward to Shulk and Nikol; "Heheh... Looks like I'll have my hands full. Nothing a mechanic loves more!"</p>
<p>Shulk: "I can't wait to get started too! Let's get our technically-minded bods together and start planning. Nikol, could you get our experts to gather round?"</p>
<p>"Sure, I can do that."</p>
<p>Hamill offered to accompany, "Oh! I'll go as well!"</p>
<p>Matthew walked to the group, asked, "And if I could get the supply, logistics, provisions, and other assorted dogsbodies over here, please!"</p>
<p>Glimmer was freaking out, "Ugh, this is so slapdash... Surely it'd be better to draw up a proper plan first?"</p>
<p>A suggested, "We can play a supervisory role, then. Care to help me, Glimmer?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, sure..."</p>
<p>She looked at Matthew assigning roles and giving speeches from behind, commented, "If Matthew hadn't stepped up, all these people would never have come together on their own. Few would attempt to rally everyone under one banner, and fewer still would achieve it. We're already witness to a great feat today."</p>
<p>"For a leader, he's a real handful, that one..."</p>
<p>Matthew: "Right on, guys, there's plenty of work to go around! I know you'll do us proud!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Repairing in progress, each doing different roles, helping out in different sectors. At last, the 'brand-new' armories stood up, looking good.</p>
<p>Janus exclaimed, "By all the stars above... The Armories, as I live and breathe...!"</p>
<p>Lucille: "All they need now are a few tanks of fuel and they should be ready to fly."</p>
<p>Jethro suggested, "Hmm... Then we'd better stock up on some, so we're ready for any eventuality."</p>
<p>Linka agreed, "We can't very well afford to be sitting around in Colony 9, indeed."</p>
<p>Panacea: "You said it... As soon as this Alpha thing is resolved, we'll be right back to our war against Moebius. First off, we should find someplace we can stay hidden from them."</p>
<p>Mickey was reminded of something sad, dropped his head, "Good point. I'll be damned if I let those scumbags steal our home from us a second time...!"</p>
<p>Dillon: "I feel exactly the same, Mickey, my chum. And we won't let 'em. Never again."</p>
<p>Saomi: "Sounds to me like we'll be sticking together for quite some time, then."</p>
<p>Janus: "Indubitably, for we are now fateful companions, bound by the red thread of common destiny, and no mistaking!"</p>
<p>Matthew agreed, "Yeah, what Janus said. When we leave here, it'll be as one people. The Armories are gonna make that happen."</p>
<p>Dillon: "Well then, it's all up to you guys now. We'll keep Colony 9 safe. Nobody's dying on my watch. That goes for you too, Matt. You die out there, I'll kick your arse."</p>
<p>"Heh, I hear ya!" And they leave for Alpha, the rest watching them go.</p>

<p>Looking at the battlefield where the two Ferronises had fallen, after they saved Glimmer and Nikol, A commented, "'Moebius Hunters', hm? We seem to have earned ourselves <em>quite</em> the sobriquet..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Hahahah! Our reputation precedes us!</strong>"</p>
<p>"This is no laughing matter, Matthew. Taking Moebius head-on is <strong>extremely</strong> ill-advised. If they <strong>really</strong> brought their might to bear, I wouldn't rate our chances highly. <strong>Case in point</strong>, our <strong>previous</strong> encounter with that Kevesi colony. <strong>Get it, Matthew?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Oh, that? I mean</strong>, they came right at us and we gave 'em a flick on the nose, <strong>right?</strong>"</p>
<p>"You went at the colony with your <em>fists</em> and ended up destroying the whole Ferronis. And you call it a 'flick on the nose'? Really?"</p>
<p>"Uhh..."</p>
<hr />
<p>In Aurora Shelf, they were looking at the Great Sword piercing in the distance. The far view makes the sword's hilt looked far taller than the clouds. Even the night sky illuminated by starlight can't prevent a black silhouette from looming out there visibly.</p>
<p>"<strong>Check this out...</strong> Nice view of Cadensia's Great Sword from here too, huh..."</p>
<p>"Hmm... The way I hear it, it's hotly-contested territory for Keves and Agnus," shared A.</p>
<p>"Erm... I-I've heard so too," added Nikol. "There was some large-scale battle there, earlier..."</p>
<p>Matthew: "Sure, so it's like a... <strong>key</strong> position that the two Castles <strong>glare</strong> at each other over. Both Keves and Agnus must want what's there for some strategic reason, I guess."</p>
<p>"In every age, <em>the sword is the fulcrum of conflict</em>," says she whom traveled and knew the history for long.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside a tomb that looked majestic. Well, dark and gloomy, except the tomb that stood out. There was a hole opened that gave light to the chamber. Matthew asked, "Hello? What's this <strong>giant</strong> rock?"</p>
<p>"It's a sarcophagus, a stone coffin. Contained within is a body... Ah, a husk, I mean." explained she whom knew even longer history when husks don't evaporate into nothingness.</p>
<p>"A husk?" that's something new to Nikol.</p>
<p>"Are you serious? <strong>Isn't it a bit large</strong> for a single husk?"</p>
<p>"Nobody said it was for a 'human'."</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>Matthew, hearing so, was more afraid of the unknown than curious, "What say we leave it the <strong>hell</strong> alone."</p>
<hr />
<p>Also at Yesterdale, but the place used to be a village that had been burnt down to the ground. Despite, some pillars and structures survived the fire. Trees were dead, but their trunks remained. Ground remained untilled and no sight of plants growing despite looking abandoned for long. Near the place, there was a tree full of red leaves{{footnote: If you watched or read Xenoblade 3, it's the Saffronia.}}</p>
<p>"Matthew, <em>this place...</em>"</p>
<p>"Chyra's settlement," he immediately answered. "We were going to build a second City... Her family and others, came here to lay the groundwork."</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>"And now, there's not even a single City left <strong>anywhere... But I swear, I'll rebuild</strong> it one day. In memory of Grandad, and all the other fallen."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ah, right! I've been meaning to say this...</strong> for a while, but... <strong>Once the City's rebuilt</strong>, you'll come with, <em>won't you, A?</em> You know you'll always be welcome."</p>
<p>"That's, ah... Well, that sounds <em>good</em>, actually. I'll think it over."</p>
<hr />
<p>Still at Yesterdale, a place called Ferronis Crater, it was a huge crater with remnants of Ferronis laid bare, surrounded by lush green grass of plains and some bioluminescent-leaves trees, and there were higher platform that they could travel that surrounded the vicinity. This is the remnants where the battle with Moebius, Glimmer's last hope of return, had left after it was destroyed. Black fog was quite thick in the area. Near the crater, there was a fenced area where seemingly someone must still be living there, whoever they are. And behind the fenced area was a river running through the bank.</p>
<p>Glimmer: "Fusing a Kevesi and Agnian Ferronis together... This is inconceivable..."</p>
<p>Rex: "<em>I hear there's a Moebius... who researches Ferronis Flame Clocks,</em> developing experimental tech and what have you. Might be his handiwork that this was <em>based on.</em>"</p>
<p>Shulk: "Yeah... But you know what?"</p>
<p>Nikol: "No, what?"</p>
<p>"It must've taken a lot of engineering to make it work. <em>I'm really curious...</em> Wish we could bring it back for analysis..."</p>
<p>Rex: "Uh-oh... Here comes Shulk's <em>fatal weakness.</em>"</p>
<p>Nikol was equally excited: "<strong>I agree, Shulk, sir! I wanna study it too!</strong>"</p>
<p>Matthew: "<strong>Don't- encourage- him!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>At a building where wooden tiled floor was, inside the building in Colony 9. They were looking out at a window when Shulk sighed, "Ah..."{{footnote: 1st floor of Dunban's house.}}</p>
<p>"You all right, Shulk?" asked Matthew.</p>
<p>"Yeah... This house- is- where a <strong>friend</strong> of mine, used to live, once. He taught me a great many things; From swordsmanship, to life advice... Truly... He was incredible."</p>
<p>"Wow..."</p>
<p>Rex: "This the mentor you used to tell me about? <em>I wish I'd gotten to meet him as well.</em> Wait... was it <strong>your mentor</strong> or your brother-in-law?" It's a house by the entrance, immediately beside the bridge. Behind was a tent that stretched out from one side, allowing one to relax, watching the river flow below while enjoying the sun and stars. A tree grew at the corner to shade any extra heat.</p>
<p>Shulk immediately shot, "Ah no he was...! Well I mean y-y-... <strong>yes</strong>, I suppose, but..."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Matthew was confused.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the workshop where Riku placed the Ouroboros Stone, Matthew noted,"So <strong>you guys</strong> had the Ouroboros Stone that was <strong>from the City</strong>, then?" The place was filled with boxes and terminals, all kinds of equipment required to perform research. Although, the place was kinda a tent at the turn of the street, so it doesn't look like soundproof, eh.</p>
<p>Shulk agreed, "Yeah, some refugees fleeing the City entrusted it to us."</p>
<p>"My Grandad spent <strong>years</strong> studying that thing. He'd say it was more important than life itself."</p>
<p>"I see... So the research documents we got with the Stone, belonged to your grandfather?"</p>
<p>"<em>Ah well...</em> Without Grandad it's just a giant <strong>paperweight</strong>, anyway..."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Matthew. Riku and I will be more than happy to take over research on the Ouroboros Stone. I promise you, we won't let your grandfather's work go to waste."</p>
<p>"Right... Cheers for that, Shulk. I'm sure Grandad would be happy."</p>
<p>Rex: "Eh, and it's not like we're exactly, <strong>strangers</strong> to that thing, <strong>anyhow.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh? <strong>Oh really?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>It's been given to you by <strong>Nia</strong>, the Queen of Agnus, right?</em> Well then... It's got to be kept safe at <strong>all</strong> cost. No- matter- what."{{footnote: It reminds him of one of his wife, so...}}</p>
<p>Shulk: "<em>Rex...</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Crossing the bridge to the tower side of Colony 9, where there were levnises parked. On the platform, Matthew asked, "What's this? <strong>Ah, a couple of Armories!</strong>"</p>
<p>Glimmer asked, "'Armories'? You mean those Levnis-looking things?" They looked like six-legged insect that grabbed onto the ground, a torso where people could mount into, and some weapons attached to the torso, or perhaps it's the jet engine?</p>
<p>"Yeah, they're the City's mobile assault vehicles. They're fitted with a <strong>pretty- nifty-</strong> cloaking device."</p>
<p>Rex explained, "We got our hands on these particular bad boys after some Moebius lackeys shot them down."</p>
<p>Shulk added, "Sadly, the impact of the crash caused <strong>significant</strong> damage to several systems."</p>
<p>"*<em>Seriously?</em> Is that why they're still in pieces?"</p>
<p>Nikol was curious, "Can't you fix 'em?"</p>
<p>Shulk replied, "We've been trying, but they've been giving us some trouble."</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Where Matthew and Dillon first talked about Na'el the day after they arrived at Colony 9, overlooking the City from afar, and the lake surrounding it, and the waterfall that filled the lake from a much taller platform. The colony wasn't the only island on the lake, though. There was a Gotrock Oracle Ruins at the edge, seemingly water fall off to lower platforms from there, and some other larger island nearer to the colony.</p>
<p>Shulk reminisced, "This takes me back. I've always liked coming here... whenever I had to do some... serious thinking."</p>
<p>Nikol: "I can see this being a good place to focus. It's quiet, no people around..."</p>
<p>"Well... in my case... I'd often get <strong>so</strong> deep in thought, I'd forget to <strong>eat</strong> all day long."</p>
<p>"That's- <em>unexpected.</em> You seem very together, Shulk."</p>
<p>"Hah... If that is so, the credit goes to someone I've known all my life, who'd bring me food here.{{footnote: His wife, Fiora.}} She supported me through thick and thin. It's thanks to her I'm here today at all... That goes for you, too."</p>
<p>"W-what was that?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer him directly, his curiosity, said instead, "Hey, Nikol. Once things have settled down, let's come here again and talk properly. We can have sandwiches together, ones with special herbs and spices, eh?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, sure! That sounds nice."</p>
<hr />
<p>At Gotrock Oracle Ruins, they looked at the stairs and platform from afar. Rex ghostly startled her, "Glimmer."</p>
<p>"Wh-what is it all of a sudden?"</p>
<p>"A long time ago, I made a decision here. That no matter what it cost me, <em>if it's for the people that count on me...</em> if it's to live up to their trust, I'd walk through hell and high water, and gladly. So..."{{footnote: Unfortunately, the Translator can't recognize where this place was in Xenoblade 2.}}</p>
<p>"W-why are you telling me this?" A sudden confession, eh?</p>
<p>"<em>I just want you to know that you're never alone.</em>"</p>
<p>"Oookay? I-I'm not following." Makes her more confusing, eh!</p>
<p>"It's fine. Don't worry about it... I've said my piece. That's enough for me... I'm pretty sure that's what <em>she wants too.</em>"</p>
<p>"Ungh..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Climbing above a tall platform of the ruins in Black Mountains region, they were looking at a giant piece of soil and rock that loomed its silhouette far beyond their current location. Rex: "Over there, you're calling that landmass Urayan Mountains these days?"</p>
<p>Nikol answered, "Yes that's right, I think..."</p>
<p>"<em>Right, right... 'Mountains'...</em>"</p>
<p>Glimmer was curious, "Hm? You wanna say something?" The clouds were low compared to the Mountains that stretched even higher into the sky.</p>
<p>"<strong>Nah just...</strong> reminiscing a bit. One time, <em>I got swallowed up</em> by them. <em>That was one <strong>helluva</strong> ride</em>."</p>
<p>"Huh?" How did a mountain even swallow you? You went into its belly?</p>
<p>Matthew exclaimed, thinking he was kidding, "<strong>Damn, Rex, YOU'RE GOOD! You almost had me there for a sec.</strong>"</p>
<p>Nikol now get it, "<strong>Oh, a joke! I-I get it...</strong>"</p>
<p>Glimmer questioned his health status, "Hey, are you feeling OK? <em>Your head, specifically?</em>" She put her hands on his forehead.</p>
<p>How could they not believed him? "<strong>Hey, lay off me!</strong> <em>I guess it does kinda sound like a fever dream.</em>"{{footnote: If you watched Xenoblade 2, you'd know some City was built inside the stomach of that Urayan Titan.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>At the hall of a building in Prison Island. The buildings were so tall, perhaps 10 storeys, they looked like not built for human size. The staircase to the side were wide and big too, allowing for 3 horses to cross side by side, if horses can go up staircase. Along the center was a long alleyway that leads to some altar-looking place?</p>
<p>Matthew noted: "So the inside of Prison Island looks like some kinda ruin as well, huh."</p>
<p>Nikol don't like it: "It's... a really unpleasant place." The black fog shrouded their view a lot, making it damp and dark.</p>
<p>"Well, for a place called something like 'Prison Island',... it's at least pretty damn spacious, innit? Wonder what it was meant to imprison?"</p>
<p>"Hhhh..." It's not something Shulk want to recall.</p>
<p>Glimmer added, "And it's got those monsters, shrouded in black fog..."</p>
<p>A introduced, "Those, are Fogbeasts. Signs of the strained world the black fog birthed... And <strong>now</strong> servants of Alpha. But originally, something that had no place existing."</p>
<p>Matthew exclaimed, "I don't wanna stay here longer than I need to."</p>
<hr />
<p>On top of an icy platform on Black Mountains, a platform on Prison Island outdoors, there were chains shoulder high preventing them from falling over the ledge. Looking up from here, the tip of the prison island pierced high into the sky, as if into Origin. The view angle against the horizontal was around 80°, very steep indeed, and still long way to go.</p>
<p>Matthew: "Huhhh... Why d'you reckon it is? It's the first time I've ever seen Origin, but <em>it feels like I've already known it forever</em>..."</p>
<p>A: "You know, it might not be just your imagination." The Great Sword, though, the tip of its hilt reached the middle of Origin, where Origin is now floating.</p>
<p>"Huh? Whaddya mean, A?"</p>
<p>"The <strong>Blade</strong> <em>you wield</em>... Those are very special metal embedded within it. And that metal... is a shard of Origin."</p>
<p>"Wha-?! <strong>Are you sure?</strong> But Grandad <strong>gave</strong> me this..."</p>
<p>"Ever since you took up that Blade, your fate has been <strong>inextricably</strong> entwined with Origin."</p>
<p>"<em>Huhhh....</em>"</p>
<p>"And now finally... you stand at its threshold. <strong>This</strong>, is the time to unlock your destiny. <strong>Reach out</strong> and seize the future you desire, Matthew."</p>
<p>"Yeah... <strong>I'm gonna. We have to keep living</strong> in this world... And for that... Alpha's got to go."</p>
<p>"You'll have my help as well. It is for the sake of this moment... that I have traveled with you thus far."</p>
<p>"Thank you, A."</p>

<h2 id="description-of-them-thousands-of-years-later"><a class="header" href="#description-of-them-thousands-of-years-later">Description of them Thousands of years later</a></h2>
<p>These are encarved in the new city's memorial hall, where the "six founders" had their statues raised, and their descriptions are as below.</p>
<p>Nikol Ortiz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the founder of House Ortiz and the City's Liberator. A Kevesi soldier, this Founder was released from the Flame Clock system by the other Founders, and henceforth, spent every last ounce of his energy for the cause: to liberate the City as one of the first Ouroboros. With surpassing skill in mechanical engineering, the Founder fought not with a Blade, but with a weapon of his own fabrication. He was also responsible for laying the foundations of all the mechanical system supporting the City to this day. Following the fight against Moebius, he poured the remainder of his days into rebuilding the City, before finally perishing at the age of 80 years, though how he attained that feat despite his origins as a Kevesi soldier remains unexplained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shulk (Panacea Reid):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Reid and the City's Liberatrix. Rather than the Founder herself, this statue depicts the Founder's mentor figure, standing as a sign of the deep reverence and devotion she felt for her teacher. The founder's master was unconnected to her by bonds of blood yet he raised her as would befits child of one's own, it is said. Though of calm and constant disposition, the sight of him on the battlefield, great red sword in hand, struck fear into many a Moebius; and though the vicious struggle against Moebius cost this ferocious warrior his right arm, the loss did nothing to diminish his desire to hone his martial skills each day, standing as vivid testament to his indomitable will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Na'el Doyle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Doyle and the City's Liberatrix. Directly descended from those who established the first, original City. Her whereabouts were lost after N's ravaging of the City of old, but upon encountering the other Founders, she committed herself fully to the fight. This Founder is said to have a familial relation to the Founder of Vandham, with scant extant records suggesting they were likely brother and sister. She fought alongside the Founder of Vandham then, who was the elder of the two, and brought the power of Ouroboros to completion. Said to have been bright and wise, this Founder laid the cornerstones for much of the City's governance and legal systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matthew Vandham:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Vandham, and the City's Restorer and Liberator. THe original incarnation of the City was once laid to ruin by Moebius N's hand. The Founder realized fully the power of Ouroboros, heretofore limited, and fought against N, ousting him. Once victorious, he gathered the old City's people, scattered to the winds, and reestablished the City. With the City restored, he left its government in the hands of the Founder Doyle, and departed on a lonely expedition. <em>No records exist of his fate thereafter. Heirs of Vandham's lineage only returned to the new City several centuries later.</em> Oral tradition has it that the Founder was master of the classical art of fist fighting, and the scions of House Vandham carry on the custom to this day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rex (Linka Cassini):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Cassini and the City's Liberatrix. Much like with the Founder of Reid, this statue, too, depicts this Founder's respected mentor rather than the Founder herself. The mentor boasted a robust physique, wielding 2 great swords at once with utmost ease, and facing down Moebius despite the loss of one eye. He lived his life an unsophisticated sort, broad-minded but impassioned, and is said to have aided the Founders in the fight against Moebius, physically and spiritually. He was further reported to have been a free spirit, whose qualities influenced the other Founders, still young and impressible when the City was restored. Indelible proof of this rebellious spirit can be seen time and again in the ethos of the House in generations to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glimmer Rhodes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A soldier of Agnus, this Founder's fight to the death against the Founder of Ortiz, a soldier of Keves, was interrupted by a chance meeting with other Founders. Freed from the bondage of her Flame Clock, she joined the fight against Moebius. Although a soldier, the Founder is reported to have been exceedingly gentle and kind at heart. Additionally, her skill in the healing arts greatly contributed to the development of medical science in the City in later ages. And irrespective of starting life as an Agnian soldier, she is said to have surpassed 80 years of age, though the way she achieved that remains shrouded in mystery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if the story is short, there are some stories which we could learn. For example, how Glimmer and Nikol whom used to be enemies became friends. Nikol is more relieved and easier to accept the enemy than Glimmer. What makes them relatively easier than in real life to put down is, first, the author wanted them to. Second, they had no conflict other than that of physical. If they'd difference in beliefs, they wouldn't have so easily tolerated each other. Plus, Matthew gave them a common enemy to unite them: Moebius. (No, not Alpha, that's acquired later, and not that Matthew agrees Alpha is the enemy from early on, at least not before he knew whom Alpha was). Refer to <em>The Power of Strangers</em> by Joe Keohane.</p>
<p>From Matthew's standpoint, it's quite hearthurt to have the old guys retained info from him. Sure, they don't want him to lose his hope that Na'el had been taken hostage willingly; but, apart from their underestimation of his optimism, white lie is not less worse than black lie: they're both a lie. And retaining info is a white lie.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole story, the goal is only one -- get Na'el back to Matthew's side. No, the search for City people are just a stepping stone to finding Na'el. He cares but not as much as Na'el. Upon finding Na'el, she does not want to go back to him; and his goal is to convince her to go back with him. He started with denial -- and A broke his dreams. Now that part is interesting, because <em>we</em> start with denial too. We deny because <strong>when people change, we don't change our <em>them</em></strong>. <em>They</em> who lives in our brain is still their old selves, the one that hadn't changed. Supposingly, we should've updated our models of them, albeit not perfectly, at least what they'd displayed; but no, we held on to our old models, believing they don't change. That's why, if you had childhood friends whom you don't meet often, or whom you don't met for a long time, when you visit each other, don't think of each other as still the same as before. Time took its carvings on their personality and behaviors.</p>
<p>While Rex said Logos is male, Pneuma is female, then Ontos is both; one had another look. Being a computer processor, just like that installed on your desktop/laptop, it is sexless. You can want it to be male, or you can want it to be female. What, it's just one click away on changing the voice of your AI from one sex to another, no?</p>
<p>See you in the next book!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Agnus:</strong> One of the two factions fighting. They wore mostly-white uniform.</li>
<li><strong>Aionios:</strong> The world that they're living in.</li>
<li><strong>Black Fog:</strong> The purple-black fog that shrouded some location of Aionios. Perhaps it was created during the clashing of the two worlds, and where it is thick, there's a high probability of annihilation event happening.</li>
<li><strong>Ferronis:</strong> The heart of a colony. It is where the Flame Clock was hosted, the largest structure of a colony, and is driven into battle so the Flame Clock can absorb the life flames (red motes) of the fallen soldiers. When not in war, it hosted some space for living, or offices.</li>
<li><strong>Keves:</strong> One of the two factions fighting. They wore mostly-navy-blue uniforms.</li>
<li><strong>Levnises:</strong> The equivalent of our "tank": war machines that drove into the battlefield that can fire shots, missiles, or rays, at the enemy. There are various types of these; but they're not important for us to distinguish.</li>
<li><strong>Moebius:</strong> The conqueror of the world. They froze the time, at the will of the inhabitants of Aionios.</li>
<li><strong>Monado:</strong> God's weapon. Only a God can wield a Monado. The sword had a ring in its Ricasso that have various symbols; such symbols were displayed when an art is played. Ultimately, the final symbol, 神, signifies its true form: unleashing the full power a God can wield. Beneath it, 斬 (slicing from top to bottom) is about the strongest physical attack one can get (as of gameplay, compared to other symbols, not to other weapons, of course).</li>
<li><strong>Ouroboros:</strong> The special power wielded by some inhabitants that're capable to hurt Moebius. Non-Ouroboros had limited power against Moebius, unless they are <em>really</em> strong. Ouroboros power made it much easier to negate the power of Moebius.</li>
<li><strong>Term Symbol:</strong> A symbol that showed which term the soldier is in. It starts out fully red, and gradually grayed out. It looks like a single diamon in the middle, and a smaller diamond on each of NESW (compass) direction; with the one to its left and right having an extra line piercing through the center of the diamond.</li>
<li><strong>Trinity Processor:</strong> The computer that connect with some weird 'entity' that allowed mad scientist Dr. Klaus used to wipe out every single lifeform on the old world, split the world into two, and create a new world with. They're Logos, Pneuma, and Ontos respectively, forming the Trinity Disciple of God Klaus. In Xenoblade 1, Ontos appeared as Alvis. In Xenoblade 2, Logos as Malus, Pneuma as Mythra (and Pyra). Pyra is Glimmer's mom. The Trinity Processors composed of each a crystal the shape of a cross, like the Christian's one, except that the horizontal lines isn't a line but a tiny triangle poking out of its vertical. The color differs, though. Ontos is more reddish-orange; Logos is dark purple, while Pneuma is greenish-yellow.</li>
